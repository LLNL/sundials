{\kinsol} solves nonlinear algebraic systems in real space, which
we write as \index{nonlinear system!definition|)}
\begin{equation}\label{nonlinear_system}
  F(u) = 0 \, , \quad F:\mbox{\bf R}^N \rightarrow \mbox{\bf R}^N \, ,
\end{equation}
given an initial guess $u_0$. \index{nonlinear
system!definition|(}

{\kinsol} employs the Inexact Newton method developed in
\cite{Bro:87,BrSa:90,DES:82} and further described in
\cite{DeSc:96,Kel:95}, resulting in the following iteration:

\index{Inexact Newton iteration!definition|)} \vspace{1ex}
\noindent{\bf Inexact Newton iteration}
\begin{enumerate}
   \item Set $u_0 = $ an initial guess
   \item For $n = 0, 1, 2,...$ until convergence do:
      \begin{itemize}
          \item[(a)] Approximately solve $J(u_n)\delta_n = -
          F(u_n)$ \label{e:Newton}
          \item[(b)] Set $u_{n+1} = u_n + \lambda \delta_n$,
          $0 < \lambda \leq 1$
          \item[(c)] Test for convergence
      \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
\index{Inexact Newton iteration!definition|)} Here, $u_n$ is the
$n$th iterate to $u$, and $J(u) = F'(u)$ is the system Jacobian.
As this code module is anticipated for use on large systems, only
iterative methods are provided to solve the system in step 2(a).
These solutions are only approximate.  At each stage in the
iteration process, a scalar multiple of the approximate solution,
$\delta_n$, is added to $u_n$ to produce a new iterate, $u_{n+1}$.
A test for convergence is made before the iteration continues.

The linear iterative method currently implemented is one of the
class of Krylov methods, GMRES \cite{BrHi:89,SaSc:86}, provided
through the {\spgmr} module common to all {\sundials} codes. Use of
{\spgmr} provides a linear solver which, by default, is applied in a
matrix-free manner, with matrix-vector products $Jv$ obtained by
either finite difference quotients or a user-supplied routine. In
the case where finite differences are used, the matrix-vector
product $J(u)v$ is approximated by a quotient of the form given by
\begin{equation}\label{jacobv}
J(u) v \approx [F(u+\sigma v) - F(u)]/\sigma \,
\end{equation}
where $u$ is the current approximation to a root of
(\ref{nonlinear_system}), and $\sigma$ is a scalar. The choice of
$\sigma$ is taken from \cite{BrSa:90} and is given by
\begin{equation}\label{sigma_comp}
  \sigma = \frac{\max \{|u^T v|, \mbox{typ}u^T |v|\}}{\|v\|_2}
  \mbox{sign}(u^T v) \sqrt{U} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $\mbox{typ}u$ is a vector of typical values for the absolute
values of the solution (and can be taken to be inverses of the
scale factors given for $u$ as described below), and $U$ is unit
roundoff. Convergence of the Newton method is maintained as long
as the value of $\sigma$ remains appropriately small as shown in
\cite{Bro:87}.

To the above methods are added scaling and preconditioning.
Scaling is allowed for both the solution vector and the system
function vector. For scaling to be used, the user should supply
values $D_u$, which are diagonal elements of the scaling matrix
such that $D_u u_n$ has all components roughly the same magnitude
when $u_n$ is close to a solution, and $D_F$, which are diagonal
scaling matrix elements such that $D_F F$ has all components
roughly the same magnitude when $u_n$ is not too close to a
solution. In the text below, we use the following scaled norms:
\begin{equation}
\|z\|_{D_u} = \|D_u z\|_2, \;\; \|z\|_{D_F} = \|D_F z\|_2, \;\;
\|z\|_{D_u,\infty} = \|D_u z\|_{\infty}, \;\; {\rm and} \;\;
\|z\|_{D_F,\infty} = \|D_F z\|_{\infty}
\end{equation}
where $\| \cdot \|_{\infty}$ is the max norm.  When scaling values
are provided for the solution vector, these values are
automatically incorporated into the calculation of $\sigma$ in
(\ref{sigma_comp}). Additionally, right preconditioning is
provided if the preconditioning setup and solve routines are
supplied by the user. In this case, GMRES is applied to the linear
systems $(JP^{-1})(P\delta) = -F$, where $P$ denotes the right
preconditioning matrix.

Two methods of applying a computed step $\delta_n$ to the
previously computed solution vector are implemented. The first and
simplest is the Inexact Newton strategy which applies step 2(b) as
above with $\lambda$ always set to $1$. The other method is a
global strategy, which attempts to use the direction implied by
$\delta_n$ in the most efficient way for furthering convergence of
the nonlinear problem. This technique is implemented in the second
strategy, called Linesearch.  This option employs both the
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ conditions of the Goldstein-Armijo linesearch
given in \cite{DeSc:96} for step 2(b), where $\lambda$ is chosen
to guarantee a sufficient decrease in $F$ relative to the step
length as well as a minimum step length relative to the initial
rate of decrease of $F$.  One property of the algorithm is that
the full Newton step tends to be taken close to the solution.  For
more details, the reader is referred to \cite{DeSc:96}.

Stopping criteria for the Newton method can be required for either
or both of the nonlinear residual and the step length.  For the
former, the Newton iteration must pass a stopping test
\[ \|F(u_n)\|_{D_F,\infty} < \mbox{\sc ftol} \, , \]
where {\sc ftol} is an input scalar tolerance with a default value
of $U^{1/3}$. For the latter, the Newton method will terminate
when the maximum scaled step is below a given tolerance
\[ \|\delta_n\|_{D_u,\infty} < \mbox{\sc steptol} \, , \]
where {\sc steptol} is an input scalar tolerance with a default
value of $U^{2/3}$.

Three options for stopping criteria for the linear system solve
are implemented, including the two algorithms of Eisenstat and
Walker \cite{EiWa:96}. The Krylov iteration must pass a stopping
test
\[ \|J \delta_n + F\|_{D_F} < (\eta_n + U) \|F\|_{D_F} \, , \]
where $\eta_n$ is one of:
\begin{itemize}
\item Eisenstat and Walker Choice 1
  \[
  \eta_n = \frac{\left|\; \|F(u_n)\|_{D_F}
      - \|F(u_{n-1}) + J(u_{n-1}) \delta_n \|_{D_F}
      \; \right|}
  {\|F(u_{n-1})\|_{D_F}} \, ,
  \]
\item Eisenstat and Walker Choice 2
  \[
  \eta_n = \gamma
  \left( \frac{ \|F(u_n)\|_{D_F}}{\|F(u_{n-1})\|_{D_F}} \right)^{\alpha} \, ,
  \]
where default values of $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ are $0.9$ and $2$,
 respectively.
\item  $\eta_n$ = constant with 0.1 as the default.
\end{itemize}
The default is Eisenstat and Walker Choice 1. For both options 1
and 2, appropriate safeguards are incorporated to ensure that
$\eta$ does not decrease too quickly~\cite{EiWa:96}.

As a user option, {\kinsol} permits the application of inequality
constraints, $u^i > 0$ and $u^i < 0$, as well as $u^i \geq 0$ and
$u^i \leq 0$, where $u^i$ is the $i$th component of $u$.  Any such
constraint, or no constraint, may be imposed on each component.
{\kinsol} will reduce step lengths in order to ensure that no
constraint is violated.  Specifically, if a new Newton iterate
will violate a constraint, the maximum (over all $i$) step length
along the Newton direction that will satisfy all constraints is
found and $\delta_n$ in Step 2(b) is scaled to take a step of that
length.
