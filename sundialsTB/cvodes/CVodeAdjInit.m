function status = CVodeAdjInit(steps, interp)
%CVodeAdjInit allocates and initializes memory for ASA with CVODES.
%
%   Usage: CVodeAdjInit(STEPS, INTEPR) 
%
%   STEPS    specifies the (maximum) number of integration steps between two 
%            consecutive check points.
%   INTERP   Specifies the type of interpolation used for estimating the forward 
%            solution during the backward integration phase. INTERP should be
%            'Hermite', indicating cubic Hermite interpolation, or 'Polynomial',
%            indicating variable order polynomial interpolation.
