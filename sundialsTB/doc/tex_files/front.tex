\section{Introduction}

{\sundials}~\cite{HBGLSSW:04}, SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers,
is a family of software tools for integration of ODE and DAE initial value problems
and for the solution of nonlinear systems of equations.
It consists of {\cvode}, {\ida}, and {\kinsol}, and variants of these with 
sensitivity analysis capabilities.

{\sundialsTB} is a collection of {\matlab} functions which provide interfaces to
the {\sundials} solvers.

The core of each {\matlab} interface in {\sundialsTB} is a single {\sc mex} 
file which interfaces to the various user-callable functions for that solver.
However, this {\sc mex} file should not be called directly, but rather through the 
user-callable functions provided for each {\matlab} interface.

A major design principle for {\sundialsTB}
was to provide an interface that is, as much as possible, equally familiar to
both {\sundials} users and {\matlab} users. Moreover, we tried to keep the
number of user-callable functions to a minimum. For example, the {\cvodes} {\matlab} 
interface contains only 12 such functions, 2 of which relate to forward sensitivity analysis and
4 more interface solely to the adjoint sensitivity module in {\cvodes}. 
A user who is only interested in integration of ODEs and not in sensitivity analysis
therefore needs to call at most 6 functions.
In tune with the {\matlab} {\sc odeset} function, optional
solver inputs in {\sundialsTB} are specified through a single function; e.g.
{\tt CvodeSetOptions} for {\cvodes} (a similar function is used to specify optional
inputs for forward sensitivity analysis). However, unlike the ODE solvers in {\matlab}, we
have kept the more flexible {\sundials} model in which a separate ``solve'' function 
({\tt CVodeSolve} for {\cvodes}) must be called to return the solution at a desired 
output time. Solver statistics, as well as optional outputs (such as
solution and solution derivatives at additional times) can be obtained at any time
with calls to separate functions ({\tt CVodeGetStats} and {\tt CVodeGet} for {\cvodes}).

This document provides a complete documentation for the {\sundialsTB} functions.
For additional details on the methods and underlying {\sundials} software consult
also the coresponding {\sundials} user guides~\cite{cvodes_ug,idas_ug,kinsol_ug}.

\noindent{\bf Requirements.}
For parallel support, {\sundialsTB} depends on {\mpiTB} with {\sc lam} v $> 7.1.1$ (for MPI-2 spawning feature).
The required software packages can be obtained from the following addresses.

\section{Installation} 

The following steps are required to install and setup {\sundialsTB}:

\subsection{Compilation and installation of sundialsTB}

As of version 2.3.0, {\sundialsTB} is distributed only with the complete {\sundials} package
and, on *nix systems (or under cygwin in Windows), the {\matlab} toolbox can be configured,
built, and installed using the main {\sundials} configure script. For details see the
{\sundials} file {\tt INSTALL\_NOTES}. 

For systems that do not support configure scripts (or if the configure script fails to
configure {\sundialsTB}), we provide a {\matlab} script ({\tt install\_STB.m}) which can be used
to build and install {\sundialsTB} from within {\matlab}. In the sequel, we assume that the 
{\sundials} package was unpacked under the directory {\em srcdir}. The {\sundialsTB} files are 
therefore in {\em srcdir}{\tt /sundialsTB}. 

To facilitate the compilation of {\sundialsTB} on platforms that do not have
a make system, we rely on {\matlab}'s mex command. Compilation of {\sundialsTB}
is done by running from under {\matlab} the {\tt install\_STB.m} script which is
present in the {\sundialsTB} top directory.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Launch matlab in sundialsTB
\begin{verbatim}
    % cd srcdir/sundialsTB
    % matlab
\end{verbatim}

\item Run the install\_STB matlab script

     Note that parallel support will be compiled into the MEX files only if
     \$LAMHOME is defined {\bf and}
     \$MPITB\_ROOT is defined {\bf and}
     {\em srcdir}/src/nvec\_par exists.

     After the MEX files are generated, you will be asked if you wish to install 
     the {\sundialsTB} toolbox. If you answer yes, you will be then asked for the
     installation directory (called in the sequel {\em instdir}). 
     To install {\sundialsTB} for all {\matlab} users (not usual), assuming {\matlab} is 
     installed under {\tt /usr/local/matlab7}, specify
        {\em instdir} = {\tt /usr/local/matlab7/toolbox}.
     To install {\sundialsTB} for just one user (usual configuration), install      
     {\sundialsTB} under a directory of your choice (typically under your {\tt matlab}
     working directory). In other words, specify
        {\em instdir} = {\tt /home/user/matlab}.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Configuring Matlab's startup}

After a successful installation, a {\sundialsTB}.m startup script is generated
in {\em instdir}{\tt /sundialsTB}. This file must be called by {\matlab} at initialization.

If {\sundialsTB} was installed for all {\matlab} users (not usual), add the {\sundialsTB} 
startup to the system-wide startup file (by linking or copying):

\begin{verbatim}
     % cd /usr/local/matlab7/toolbox/local
     % ln -s ../sundialsTB/startup_STB.m .
\end{verbatim}

and add these lines to your original local startup.m

\begin{verbatim}
     % SUNDIALS Toolbox startup M-file, if it exists.
     if exist('startup_STB','file')
        startup_STB
     end
\end{verbatim}

If {\sundialsTB} was installed for just one user (usual configuration) and
assuming you do not need to keep any previously existing startup.m, link 
or copy the startup\_STB.m script to your working 'matlab' directory:

\begin{verbatim}
     % cd ~/matlab
     % ln -s sundialsTB/startup_STB.m startup.m
\end{verbatim}

If you already have a startup.m, use the method described above, first linking 
(or copying) {\tt startup\_STB.m} to the destination subdirectory and then editing 
the file {\tt ~/matlab/startup.m} to run {\tt startup\_STB.m}.

\subsection{Testing the installation}

If everything went fine, you should now be able to try one of the {\cvodes}, IDAS,
or KINSOL examples (in matlab, type 'help cvodes', 'help idas', or 'help kinsol' 
to see a list of all examples available). For example, cd to the {\cvodes} serial 
example directory:
\begin{verbatim}
     % cd instdir/sundialsTB/cvode/examples_ser
\end{verbatim}
and then launch matlab and execute cvdx.
