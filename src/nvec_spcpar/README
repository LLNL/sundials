                     NVECTOR_SPCPARALLEL
                  Release 2.3.0, November 2006

MPI spc_parallel implementation of the NVECTOR module for SUNDIALS for
semi-discretized 2D or 3D PDEs. The local data is organized in several
groups of variables, igrp=1..Ngrps. Each group consists of 1...Nspc(igrp)
variables (species). The spatial indexes may also include ghost data points.
In other words, the data is organized as a multi-dimensional array,
in which the indexes vary (from the slowest to the fastest) as follows:
   igrp ( = 0...Ngrp-1)
   iz   ( = 0...Nz+2*NGz-1)
   iy   ( = 0...Ny+2*NGy-1)
   ix   ( = 0...Nx+2*NGx-1)
   ispc ( = 0...Nspc(igrp)-1)
For 2D PDEs, the user should specify Nz=1, NGz=0.

NVECTOR_SPCPARALLEL defines the content field of N_Vector to be a structure 
with the following fields:
  Ngrp       number of variable groups
  Nspc       array providing the number of species in each group
  Nx         local x-mesh vector length
  Ny         local y-mesh vector length
  Nz         local z-mesh vector length
  NGx        x-width of ghost boundary
  NGy        y-width of ghost boundary
  NGz        z-width of ghost boundary
  n1         array of local vector lengths for each group
  n          local vector length
  N          global vector length
  data       local data array
  gdata      pointers in data at start of group data
  own_data   flag for ownership of data
  comm       MPI communicator

NVECTOR_SPCPARALLEL defines several macros to provide access to the content 
of an spc_parallel N_Vector, several constructors for variables of type N_Vector,
constructors for an array of variables of type N_Vector, and destructors
for N_Vector and N_Vector array.

NVECTOR_SPCPARALLEL provides implementations for all vector operations defined
by the generic NVECTOR module in the table of operations.


A. Documentation
----------------

The MPI spc_parallel NVECTOR implementation is fully described in the user
documentation for any of the SUNDIALS solvers [1,2,3,4]. PostScript
and PDF files for the user guide for a particular solver are available
in the solver's directory.


B. Installation
---------------

For basic installation instructions see /sundials/INSTALL. 
For complete installation instructions see any of the user guides.
