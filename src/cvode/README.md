CVODE is a package for the solution of stiff and nonstiff ordinary differential
equation (ODE) systems (initial value problems) given in explicit form
```
dy/dt = f(t,y), y(t0) = y0.
```
CVODE provides a choice of two variable-order, variable-coefficient multistep
methods, Adams-Moulton methods for non-stiff problems or BDF (Backward
Differentiation Formula) methods in fixed-leading-coefficient form for stiff
problems.

CVODE is part of the SUNDIALS Suite of Nonlinear and Differential/Algebraic
equation Solvers which consists of ARKode, CVODE, CVODES, IDA, IDAS and KINSOL.
It is written in ANSI standard C and can be used in a variety of computing
environments including serial, shared memory, distributed memory, and
accelerator-based (e.g., GPU) systems. This flexibility is obtained from a
modular design that leverages the shared vector, matrix, linear solver, and
nonlinear solver APIs used across SUNDIALS packages.

For use with Fortran applications, a set of Fortran/C interface routines, called
FCVODE, is also supplied. These are written in C, but assume that the user
calling program and all user-supplied routines are in Fortran.
