IDAS is a package for the solution of differential-algebraic equation (DAE)
systems
```
F(t,y,y',p) = 0, y(t0) = y0(p), y'(t0) = y0'(p)
```
with sensitivity analysis capabilities (both forward and adjoint modes). The
integration methods used in IDAS are variable-order, variable-coefficient BDF
(Backward Differentiation Formula) methods in fixed-leading-coefficient form.

IDAS is part of the SUNDIALS Suite of Nonlinear and Differential/Algebraic
equation Solvers which consists of ARKode, CVODE, CVODES, IDA, IDAS and KINSOL.
It is written in ANSI standard C and can be used in a variety of computing
environments including serial, shared memory, distributed memory, and
accelerator-based (e.g., GPU) systems. This flexibility is obtained from a
modular design that leverages the shared vector, matrix, linear solver, and
nonlinear solver APIs used across SUNDIALS packages.
