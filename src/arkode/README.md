ARKode is a package for the solution of stiff, nonstiff, and multirate ordinary
differential equation (ODE) systems (initial value problems) given in linearly
implicit the form
```
M y' = f1(t,y) + f2(t,y), y(t0) = y0.
```
The integration methods implemented in ARKode include explicit and implicit
Runge-Kutta methods, implicit-explicit (IMEX) additive Runge-Kutta methods, and
multirate infatesemial step (MIS) methods.

ARKode is part of a the SUNDIALS Suite of Nonlinear and Differential/Algebraic
equation Solvers which consists of ARKode, CVODE, CVODES, IDA, IDAS, and KINSOL.
It is written in ANSI standard C and can be used in a variety of computing
environments including serial, shared memory, distributed memory, and
accelerator-based (e.g., GPU) systems. This flexibility is obtained from a
modular design that leverages the shared vector, matrix, linear solver, and
nonlinear solver APIs used across SUNDIALS packages.

For use with Fortran applications, a set of Fortran/C interface routines, called
FARKODE, is also supplied. These are written in C, but assume that the user
calling program and all user-supplied routines are in Fortran.
