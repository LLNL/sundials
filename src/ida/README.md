IDA is a package for the solution of differential-algebraic equation (DAE)
systems
```
F(t,y,y') = 0, y(t0) = y0, y'(t0) = y0'.
```
The integration methods used in IDA are variable-order, variable-coefficient BDF
(Backward Differentiation Formula) methods in fixed-leading-coefficient form.

IDA is part of the SUNDIALS Suite of Nonlinear and Differential/Algebraic
equation Solvers which consists of ARKode, CVODE, CVODES, IDA, IDAS and KINSOL.
It is written in ANSI standard C, but is derived from the package DASPK, which
is written in FORTRAN. IDA can be used in a variety of computing environments
including serial, shared memory, distributed memory, and accelerator-based
(e.g., GPU) systems. This flexibility is obtained from a modular design that
leverages the shared vector, matrix, linear solver, and nonlinear solver APIs
used across SUNDIALS packages.

For use with Fortran applications, a set of Fortran/C interface routines, called
FIDA, is also supplied. These are written in C, but assume that the user calling
program and all user-supplied routines are in Fortran.
