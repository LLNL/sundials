\chapter{Using IDA for C Applications}\label{s:simulation}
%%===================================================================================

This chapter is concerned with the use of {\ida} for the integration of DAEs.
The following sections treat the header files, the layout of the user's main
program, description of the {\ida} user-callable functions, and 
description of user-supplied functions. 
The listings of the sample programs in the companion document \cite{ida2.4.0_ex} 
may also be helpful. Those codes may be used as templates (with the removal of
some lines involved in testing), and are included in the {\ida} package.

The user should be aware that not all linear solver modules are compatible 
with all {\nvector} implementations. 
\index{IDA@{\ida} linear solvers!NVECTOR@{\nvector} compatibility}
For example, {\nvecp} is not compatible with the direct dense or direct band 
linear solvers, since these linear solver modules need to form the complete
system Jacobian.
The {\idadense} and {\idaband} modules can only be used with {\nvecs}. 
The preconditioner module {\idabbdpre} can only be used with {\nvecp}. 

{\ida} uses various constants for both input and output.  These are
defined as needed in this chapter, but for convenience are also listed
separately in Chapter \ref{c:constants}.

%%==============================================================================
\section{Access to library and header files}\label{ss:file_access}
%%==============================================================================

At this point, it is assumed that the installation of {\ida},
following the procedure described in Chapter \ref{s:install}, has
been completed successfully.

Regardless of where the user's application program resides, its
associated compilation and load commands must make reference to the
appropriate locations for the library and header files required by
{\ida}.  The relevant library files are
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em libdir}\id{/libsundials\_ida.}{\em lib},
\item {\em libdir}\id{/libsundials\_nvec*.}{\em lib} (one or two files),
\end{itemize}
where the file extension .{\em lib} is typically \id{.so} for shared libraries
and \id{.a} for static libraries. The relevant header files are located in
the subdirectories
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em incdir}\id{/include}
\item {\em incdir}\id{/include/ida}
\item {\em incdir}\id{/include/sundials}
\end{itemize}
The directories {\em libdir} and {\em incdir} are the install libray and include
directories. For a default installation, these are {\em build\_tree}\id{/lib} and
{\em build\_tree}\id{/include}, respectively, where {\em build\_tree} was defined in
Chapter \ref{s:install}.

\section{Header files}\label{ss:header_sim}
%%===================================================================================
\index{header files}
The calling program must include several header files so that various macros
and data types can be used. The header file that is always required is:
%%
\begin{itemize}
\item  \Id{ida.h}, 
  the header file for {\ida}, which defines the several
  types and various constants, and includes function prototypes.
\end{itemize}
%%
Note that \id{ida.h} includes \Id{sundials\_types.h}, 
which defines the types \id{realtype} and \id{booleantype}
and the constants \id{FALSE} and \id{TRUE}.

The calling program must also include an {\nvector} implementation header file
(see Chapter \ref{s:nvector} for details).
For the two {\nvector} implementations that are included in the {\ida} package,
the corresponding header files are:
%%
\begin{itemize}
\item \Id{nvector\_serial.h}, 
  which defines the serial implementation {\nvecs};
\item \Id{nvector\_parallel.h}, 
  which defines the parallel MPI implementation, {\nvecp}.
\end{itemize}
%%
Note that both these files include in turn the header file \Id{sundials\_nvector.h} which 
defines the abstract \Id{N\_Vector} type. 

Finally, a linear solver module header file is required. 
\index{IDA@{\ida} linear solvers!header files}
The header files corresponding to the various linear solver options in {\ida} are
as follows:
%%
\begin{itemize}
\item \Id{ida\_dense.h}, 
  which is used with the dense direct linear solver in 
  the context of {\ida}. This in turn includes a header file (\id{sundials\_dense.h})
  which defines the \Id{DenseMat} type and corresponding accessor macros; 
\item \Id{ida\_band.h}, 
  which is used with the band direct linear solver in the
  context of {\ida}. This in turn includes a header file (\id{sundials\_band.h})
  which defines the \Id{BandMat} type and corresponding accessor macros;
\item \Id{ida\_spgmr.h}, 
  which is used with the Krylov solver {\spgmr} in the
  context of {\ida};
\item \Id{ida\_spbcgs.h}, 
  which is used with the Krylov solver {\spbcg} in the
  context of {\ida};
\item \Id{ida\_sptfqmr.h}, 
  which is used with the Krylov solver {\sptfqmr} in the
  context of {\ida};
\end{itemize}

The header files for the Krylov iterative solvers include \id{ida\_spils.h}
which defined common fuunctions and which in turn includes a header file (\id{sundials\_iterative.h})
which enumerates the kind of preconditioning and for the choices for the Gram-Schmidt process for {\spgmr}.

%%===================================================================================
\section{A skeleton of the user's main program}\label{ss:skeleton_sim}
%%===================================================================================
The following is a skeleton of the user's main program (or calling
program) for the integration of a DAE IVP. Some steps are independent of the
{\nvector} implementation used; where this is not the case, usage specifications
are given for the two implementations provided with {\ida}: steps marked with {\p}
correspond to {\nvecp}, while steps marked with {\s} correspond to {\nvecs}.
%%
%%
\index{User main program!IDA@{\ida} usage}
\begin{Steps}
  
\item 
  {\bf {\p} Initialize MPI}

  Call \id{MPI\_Init(\&argc, \&argv);} to initialize MPI if used by
  the user's program, aside from the internal use in {\nvecp}.  
  Here \id{argc} and \id{argv} are the command line argument 
  counter and array received by \id{main}.
  
\item
  {\bf Set problem dimensions}

  {\s} Set \id{N}, the problem size $N$.

  {\p} Set \id{Nlocal}, the local vector length (the sub-vector
  length for this processor); \id{N}, the global vector length (the
  problem size $N$, and the sum of all the values of \id{Nlocal});
  and the active set of processors.
    
\item
  {\bf Set vector of initial values}
 
  To set the vectors \id{y0} and \id{yp0} to initial values for $y$ and $y'$, 
  use functions defined by a particular {\nvector} implementation. 
  For the two {\nvector} implementations provided, if a \id{realtype} 
  array  \id{ydata}
  already exists, containing the initial values of $y$, make the call:

  {\s} \id{y0 = N\_VMake\_Serial(N, ydata);}

  {\p} \id{y0 = N\_VMake\_Parallel(comm, Nlocal, N, ydata);}

  Otherwise, make the call:

  {\s} \id{y0 = N\_VNew\_Serial(N);}

  {\p} \id{y0 = N\_VNew\_Parallel(comm, Nlocal, N);}

  and load initial values into the structure defined by:

  {\s} \id{NV\_DATA\_S(y0)}

  {\p} \id{NV\_DATA\_P(y0)}

  Here \id{comm} is the MPI communicator, set in one of two ways: 
  If a proper subset of active processors is to be used, \id{comm} 
  must be set by suitable MPI calls. Otherwise, to specify that all 
  processors are to be used, \id{comm} must be \id{MPI\_COMM\_WORLD}.
  
  The initial conditions for $y'$ are set similarly.

\item\label{i:ida_create} 
  {\bf Create {\ida} object}

  Call \id{ida\_mem = }\id{IDACreate}\id{();} 
  to create the {\ida} memory block.
  \id{IDACreate} returns a pointer to the {\ida} memory structure.
  See \S\ref{sss:idamalloc} for details.

\item\label{i:ida_malloc} 
  {\bf Allocate internal memory}

  Call \id{IDAMalloc}\id{(...);} 
  to provide required problem specifications,
  allocate internal memory for {\ida}, 
  and initialize {\ida}.
  \id{IDAMalloc} returns an error flag to indicate success or an illegal argument
  value.  See \S\ref{sss:idamalloc} for details.
  
\item
  {\bf Set optional inputs}

  Call \id{IDASet*} functions to change from their default values any
  optional inputs that control the behavior of {\ida}.
  See \S\ref{sss:optin_main} for details.

\item\label{i:lin_solver} 
  {\bf Attach linear solver module}

  Initialize the linear solver module
  with one of the following calls (for details see \S\ref{sss:lin_solv_init}):

  {\s} \id{flag = }\Id{IDADense}\id{(...);}

  {\s} \id{flag = }\Id{IDABand}\id{(...);}

  \id{flag = }\Id{IDASpgmr}\id{(...);}

  \id{flag = }\Id{IDASpbcg}\id{(...);}

  \id{flag = }\Id{IDASptfqmr}\id{(...);}

\item
  {\bf Set linear solver optional inputs}

  Call \id{IDA*Set*} functions from the selected linear solver module to
  change optional inputs specific to that linear solver.
  See \S\ref{sss:optin_linsol} for details.

\item 
  {\bf Correct initial values}

  Optionally, call \id{IDACalcIC} to correct the initial values
  \id{y0} and \id{yp0}.  See \S\ref{ss:idacalcic}.
  Also see \S\ref{sss:optin_iccalc} for relevant optional input calls.

\item
  {\bf Specify rootfinding problem}
  \index{Rootfinding}

  Optionally, call \id{IDARootInit} to initialize a rootfinding problem
  to be solved during the integration of the DAE system.
  See \S\ref{ss:root_uc} for details.

\item
  {\bf Advance solution in time}

  For each point at which output is desired, call
  \id{flag = }\Id{IDASolve}\id{(ida\_mem, tout, \&tret, yret, ypret, itask);}
  Set \id{itask} to specify the return mode.
  The vector \id{yret} (which can be the same as
  the vector \id{y0} above) will contain $y(t)$,
  while the vector \id{ypret} will contain $y^\prime(t)$.
  See \S\ref{sss:idasolve} for details.
  
\item
  {\bf Get optional outputs}

  Call \id{IDA*Get*} functions to obtain optional output.
  See \S\ref{ss:optional_output} and \S\ref{ss:root_uc} for details.

\item
  {\bf Deallocate memory for solution vector}

  Upon completion of the integration, deallocate memory for the vectors \id{yret}
  and \id{ypret} by calling the destructor function defined by the {\nvector} 
  implementation:

  {\s} \id{N\_VDestroy\_Serial(yret);}

  {\p} \id{N\_VDestroy\_Parallel(yret);}
  
  and similarly for \id{ypret}.
  
\item
  {\bf Free solver memory}

  \Id{IDAFree}\id{(\&ida\_mem);} to free the memory allocated for {\ida}.
  
\item 
  {\bf {\p} Finalize MPI}
  
  Call \id{MPI\_Finalize();} to terminate MPI.

\end{Steps}

\section{User-callable functions}
\label{ss:ida_fct_sim}
%%===================================================================================

This section describes the {\ida} functions that are called by the
user to set up and solve a DAE. Some of these are required. However,
starting with \S\ref{ss:optional_input}, the functions listed involve
optional inputs/outputs or restarting, and those paragraphs can be
skipped for a casual use of {\ida}. In any case, refer to
\S\ref{ss:skeleton_sim} for the correct order of these calls.
Calls related to rootfinding are described in \S\ref{s:using_rootfinding}.

\subsection{IDA initialization and deallocation functions}
\label{sss:idamalloc}
%%
The following three functions must be called in the order listed. The last one
is to be called only after the DAE solution is complete, as it frees the {\ida}
memory block created and allocated by the first two calls.
%%
\ucfunction{IDACreate}
{
  ida\_mem = IDACreate();
}
{
  The function \ID{IDACreate} instantiates an {\ida} solver object.
}
{
  \id{IDACreate} has no arguments.
}
{
  If successful, \id{IDACreate} returns a pointer to the newly created 
  {\ida} memory block (of type \id{void *}).
  If an error occurred, \id{IDACreate} prints an error message to \id{stderr}
  and returns \id{NULL}.
}
{}
%%
%%
\ucfunction{IDAMalloc}
{
flag = IDAMalloc(ida\_mem, res, t0, y0, yp0, itol, reltol, abstol);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDAMalloc} provides required problem and solution
  specifications, allocates internal memory, and initializes {\ida}.
}
{
  \begin{args}[ida\_mem]
  \item[ida\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the {\ida} memory block returned by \id{IDACreate}.
  \item[res] (\Id{IDAResFn})
    is the {\C} function which computes $F$ in the DAE. This function has the form 
    \id{res(t, yy, yp, resval, res\_data)} (for full details see
    \S\ref{ss:user_fct_sim}).
  \item[t0] (\id{realtype})
    is the initial value of $t$.
  \item[y0] (\id{N\_Vector})
    is the initial value of $y$. 
  \item[yp0] (\id{N\_Vector})
    is the initial value of $y^\prime$. 
  \item[itol] (\id{int}) 
    is one of \Id{IDA\_SS}, \Id{IDA\_SV}, or \ID{IDA\_WF}.  Here \Id{itol}
    $=$ \id{IDA\_SS} indicates scalar relative error tolerance and scalar
    absolute error tolerance, while \id{itol} $=$ \id{IDA\_SV} indicates
    scalar relative error tolerance and vector absolute error tolerance. 
    The latter choice is important when the absolute error tolerance needs to
    be different for each component of the DAE. 
    If \id{itol} $=$ \id{IDA\_WF}, the arguments \id{reltol} and \id{abstol} are
    ignored and the user is expected to provide a function to evaluate the error
    weight vector $W$, replacing (\ref{e:errwt}). See \id{IDASetEwtFn} in
    \S\ref{sss:optin_main}.
  \item[reltol] (\id{realtype})
    \index{tolerances}
    is the relative error tolerance.
  \item[abstol] (\id{void *})
    is a pointer to the absolute error tolerance. If \id{itol} $=$ \id{IDA\_SS},
    \id{abstol} must be a pointer to a \id{realtype} variable. If \id{itol}
    $=$ \id{IDA\_SV}, \id{abstol} must be an \id{N\_Vector} variable.
  \end{args}
}
{
  The return flag \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) will be one of the following:
  \begin{args}[IDA\_ILL\_INPUT]
  \item[\Id{IDA\_SUCCESS}]
    The call to \id{IDAMalloc} was successful.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_MEM\_NULL}] 
    The {\ida} memory block was not initialized through a previous call to
    \id{IDACreate}.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_MEM\_FAIL}] 
    A memory allocation request has failed.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_ILL\_INPUT}] 
    An input argument to \id{IDAMalloc} has an illegal value.
  \end{args}
}
{
  See also \S\ref{sss:tol_advice} for advice on tolerances.

  The tolerance values in \id{reltol} and \id{abstol} may be changed between
  calls to \id{IDASolve} (see \id{IDASetTolerances} in \S\ref{sss:optin_main}).

  {\warn}It is the user's responsibility to provide compatible \id{itol} and
  \id{abstol} arguments.

  If an error occurred, \id{IDAMalloc} also sends an error message to the
  error handler function.
}
%%
%%
\ucfunction{IDAFree}
{
  IDAFree(\&ida\_mem);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDAFree} frees the pointer allocated by
  a previous call to \id{IDAMalloc}.
}
{
  The argument is the pointer to the {\ida} memory block (of type \id{void *}).
}
{
  The function \id{IDAFree} has no return value.
}
{}


%%==============================================================================
\subsection{Advice on choice and use of tolerances}\label{sss:tol_advice}
%%==============================================================================

\index{tolerances}
{\bf General advice on choice of tolerances.}
For many users, the appropriate choices for tolerance values in
\id{reltol} and \id{abstol} are a concern.  The following pieces of
advice are relevant.

(1) The scalar relative tolerance \id{reltol} is to be set to control relative
errors.  So \id{reltol} = 1.0E-4 means that errors are controlled to .01\%.  We
do not recommend using \id{reltol} larger than 1.0E-3.  On the other hand,
\id{reltol} should not be so small that it is comparable to the unit roundoff
of the machine arithmetic (generally around 1.0E-15).

(2) The absolute tolerances \id{abstol} (whether scalar or vector) need to
be set to control absolute errors when any components of the solution
vector \id{y} may be so small that pure relative error control is
meaningless.  For example, if \id{y[i]} starts at some nonzero value, but in time
decays to zero, then pure relative error control on \id{y[i]} makes no sense
(and is overly costly) after \id{y[i]} is below some noise level.  Then
\id{abstol} (if scalar) or \id{abstol[i]} (if a vector) needs to be set to that
noise level.  If the different components have different noise levels,
then \id{abstol} should be a vector.  See the example \id{idadenx} in the
{\ida} package, and the discussion of it in the {\ida} Examples document
\cite{ida2.4.0_ex}.
In that problem, the three components vary betwen 0 and 1, and have
different noise levels; hence the \id{abstol} vector.  It is impossible to
give any general advice on \id{abstol} values, because the appropriate noise
levels are completely problem-dependent.  The user or modeler hopefully has
some idea as to what those noise levels are.

(3) Finally, it is important to pick all the tolerance values conservately,
because they control the error committed on each individual time step.
The final (global) errors are some sort of accumulation of those
per-step errors.  A good rule of thumb is to reduce the tolerances by a
factor of .01 from the actual desired limits on errors.  So if you
want .01\% accuracy (globally), a good choice is \id{reltol} = 1.0E-6.
But in any case, it is a good idea to do a few experiments with
the tolerances to see how the computed solution values vary as
tolerances are reduced.

\vspace{0.1in}
\index{tolerances}
{\bf Advice on controlling unphysical negative values.}
In many applications, some components in the true solution are always
positive or non-negative, though at times very small.  In the numerical
solution, however, small negative (hence unphysical) values can then
occur.  In most cases, these values are harmless, and simply need to
be controlled, not eliminated. The following pieces of advice are relevant.

(1) The way to control the size of unwanted negative computed values
is with tighter absolute tolerances.  Again this requires some
knowledge of the noise level of these components, which may or may not
be different for different components.  Some experimentation may be
needed.

(2) If output plots or tables are being generated, and it is important
to avoid having negative numbers appear there (for the sake of avoiding
a long explanation of them, if nothing else), then eliminate them, but
only in the context of the output medium.  Then the internal values carried
by the solver are unaffected.  Remember that a small negative value in \id{yret}
returned by {\ida}, with magnitude comparable to \id{abstol} or less,
is equivalent to zero as far as the computation is concerned.

(3) The user's residual routine \id{res} should never change a
negative value in the solution vector \id{yy} to a non-negative value,
as a "solution" to this problem.  This can cause instability.  If the
\id{res} routine cannot tolerate a zero or negative value (e.g. because
there is a square root or log of it), then the offending value should
be changed to zero or a tiny positive number in a temporary variable
(not in the input \id{yy} vector) for the purposes of computing $F(t,y)$.

(4) {\ida} provides the option of enforcing positivity or non-negativity
on components.  But these constraint options should only be exercised if
the use of absolute tolerances to control the computed values is
unsuccessful, because they involve some extra overhead cost.

\subsection{Linear solver specification functions}\label{sss:lin_solv_init}

As previously explained, Newton iteration requires the solution of
linear systems of the form (\ref{e:DAE_Newtoncorr}).  There are five {\ida} linear
solvers currently available for this task: {\idadense}, {\idaband}, {\idaspgmr},
{\idaspbcg}, and {\idasptfqmr}.  The first two are direct solvers and derive their
name from the type of approximation used for the Jacobian 
$J = \partial{F}/\partial{y} + c_j \partial{F}/\partial{y^\prime}$.
{\idadense} and {\idaband} work with dense and banded approximations to $J$,
respectively.  The remaining three {\ida} linear solvers, {\idaspgmr}, {\idaspbcg},
and {\idasptfqmr}, are Krylov iterative solvers. The {\spgmr}, {\spbcg}, and
{\sptfqmr} in the names indicate the scaled preconditioned GMRES, scaled
preconditioned Bi-CGStab, and scaled preconditioned TFQMR methods, respectively.
Together, they are refered to as {\idaspils} (from scaled preconditioned 
iterative linear solvers).

When using any of the Krylov linear solvers, preconditioning (on the left)
is permitted, and in fact encouraged, for the sake of efficiency.
A preconditioner matrix $P$ must approximate the Jacobian $J$, at least
crudely.  For the specification of a preconditioner, see \S\ref{sss:optin_linsol}
and \S\ref{ss:user_fct_sim}.

\index{IDA@{\ida} linear solvers!selecting one|(} 
To specify an {\ida} linear solver, after the call to \id{IDACreate} but
before any calls to \id{IDASolve}, the user's program must call one of the
functions \Id{IDADense}, \Id{IDABand}, \Id{IDASpgmr}, \Id{IDASpbcg}, or
\Id{IDASptfqmr}, as documented below. The first argument passed to these functions
is the {\ida} memory pointer returned by \id{IDACreate}.  A call to one of these
functions links the main {\ida} integrator to a linear solver and
allows the user to specify parameters which are specific to a
particular solver, such as the bandwidths in the {\idaband} case.
%%
The use of each of the linear solvers involves certain constants and possibly 
some macros, that are likely to be needed in the user code.  These are
available in the corresponding header file associated with the linear
solver, as specified below.
\index{IDA@{\ida} linear solvers!selecting one|)}

\index{IDA@{\ida} linear solvers!built on generic solvers|(} 
In each case the linear
solver module used by {\ida} is actually built on top of a generic
linear system solver, which may be of interest in itself.  These
generic solvers, denoted {\dense}, {\band}, {\spgmr}, {\spbcg}, and {\sptfqmr}, are
described separately in Chapter \ref{s:gen_linsolv}.

\subsection{Initial condition calculation function}\label{ss:idacalcic}

\id{IDACalcIC} calculates corrected initial conditions for the DAE 
system for a class of index-one problems of semi-implicit form.
(See \S{\ref{ss:ivp_sol} and Ref. \cite{BHP:98}.)
It uses Newton iteration combined with a linesearch algorithm.
Calling \id{IDACalcIC} is optional. It is only necessary when the  
initial conditions do not solve the given system.  Thus if   
\id{y0} and \id{yp0} are known to satisfy $F(t_0, y_0, y^\prime_0) = 0$, 
then a call to \id{IDACalcIC} is generally {\em not} necessary.

A call to \id{IDACalcIC} must be preceded by successful calls to  
\id{IDACreate} and \id{IDAMalloc}, and by a successful call to the 
linear system solver specification function.  
The call to \id{IDACalcIC} should precede the call(s) to \id{IDASolve}  
for the given problem.
%
\ucfunction{IDACalcIC}
{
  flag = IDACalcIC(ida\_mem, t0, y0, yp0, icopt, tout1);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDACalcIC} corrects the initial values \id{y0} and \id{yp0} at
  time \id{t0}.
}
{
  \begin{args}[ida\_mem]

  \item[ida\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the {\ida} memory block.

  \item[t0] (\id{realtype})
    is the initial value of $t$.

  \item[y0] (\id{N\_Vector})
    is the initial value of $y$. 

  \item[yp0] (\id{N\_Vector})
    is the initial value of $y^\prime$.   

  \item[icopt] (\id{int})
    is one of the following two options for the initial condition calculation.
    
    \id{icopt}$ = $\ID{IDA\_YA\_YDP\_INIT} directs \id{IDACalcIC} to compute 
    the algebraic components of $y$ and differential components of $y^\prime$, 
    given the differential components of $y$.  
    This option requires that the \id{N\_Vector} \id{id} was set through 
    \id{IDASetId}, specifying the differential and algebraic components.  
    
    \id{icopt}$ = $\ID{IDA\_Y\_INIT} directs \id{IDACalcIC} to compute all  
    components of $y$, given $y^\prime$.  In this case, \id{id} is not required.

  \item[tout1] (\id{realtype})
    is the first value of $t$ at which a solution will be requested (from
    \id{IDASolve}).  This value is needed here to determine the direction of
    integration and rough scale in the independent variable $t$.   

  \end{args}
}
{
  The return value \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) will be one of the following:

  \begin{args}[IDA\_LINESEARCH\_FAIL]

  \item[\Id{IDA\_SUCCESS}]
    \id{IDASolve} succeeded.

  \item[\Id{IDA\_MEM\_NULL}]
    The argument \id{ida\_mem} was \id{NULL}.

    The allocation function \id{IDAMalloc} has not been called.
                                                  
  \item[\Id{IDA\_ILL\_INPUT}]
    One of the input arguments was illegal.    
                                                                 
  \item[\Id{IDA\_LSETUP\_FAIL}] 
    The linear solver's setup function failed in an unrecoverable manner.

  \item[\Id{IDA\_LINIT\_FAIL}]
    The linear solver's initialization function failed.   
                                                                 
  \item[\Id{IDA\_LSOLVE\_FAIL}] 
    The linear solver's solve function failed in an unrecoverable manner.

  \item[\Id{IDA\_BAD\_EWT}]
    Some component of the error weight vector is zero (illegal), either for 
    the input value of \id{y0} or a corrected value.          
                                                                 
  \item[\Id{IDA\_FIRST\_RES\_FAIL}]
    The user's residual function returned a recoverable error flag on the first
    call, but \id{IDACalcIC} was unable to recover.       
                                                                 
  \item[\Id{IDA\_RES\_FAIL}]
    The user's residual function returned a nonrecoverable error flag.

  \item[\Id{IDA\_NO\_RECOVERY}]
    The user's residual function, or the linear solver's setup or solve function
    had a recoverable error, but \id{IDACalcIC} was unable to recover.
                                                                 
  \item[\Id{IDA\_CONSTR\_FAIL}]
    \id{IDACalcIC} was unable to find a solution    
    satisfying the inequality constraints.     
                                                                 
  \item[\Id{IDA\_LINESEARCH\_FAIL}]
    The linesearch algorithm failed to find a solution with a step larger than 
    \id{steptol} in weighted RMS norm.                      
                                                                 
  \item[\Id{IDA\_CONV\_FAIL}]
    \id{IDACalcIC} failed to get convergence of the Newton iterations.

  \end{args} 
}
{
  All failure return values are negative and therefore a test \id{flag} $< 0$
  will trap all \id{IDACalcIC} failures.

  Note that \id{IDACalcIC} is typically called after \id{IDAMalloc} and before
  the first call to \id{IDASolve}, to compute consistent initial conditions
  for the DAE problem.  However, it can be also called at any other
  time to correct a pair $(y, y^\prime)$.

%%===================================================================================

\subsection{IDA solver function}\label{sss:idasolve}
%
This is the central step in the solution process --- the call to perform the
integration of the DAE.
%
\ucfunction{IDASolve}
{
  flag = IDASolve(ida\_mem, tout, tret, yret, ypret, itask);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDASolve} integrates the DAE over an interval in $t$.
}
{
  \begin{args}[ida\_mem]
  \item[ida\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the {\ida} memory block.
  \item[tout] (\id{realtype})
    the next time at which a computed solution is desired.
  \item[tret] (\id{realtype *})
    the time reached by the solver.
  \item[yret] (\id{N\_Vector})
    the computed solution vector $y$.
  \item[ypret] (\id{N\_Vector})
    the computed solution vector $y^\prime$.
  \item[itask] (\id{int})
    \index{itask@\texttt{itask}}
    a flag indicating the job of the solver for the next user step. 
    The \Id{IDA\_NORMAL} task is to have the solver take internal steps until   
    it has reached or just passed the user specified \id{tout}
    parameter. The solver then interpolates in order to   
    return approximate values of $y($\id{tout}$)$ and $y^\prime($\id{tout}$)$. 
    The \Id{IDA\_ONE\_STEP} option tells the solver to just take one internal step  
    and return the solution at the point reached by that step. 
    The \Id{IDA\_NORMAL\_TSTOP} and \Id{IDA\_ONE\_STEP\_TSTOP} modes are     
    similar to \id{IDA\_NORMAL} and \id{IDA\_ONE\_STEP}, respectively, except    
    that the integration never proceeds past the value \id{tstop}, specified
    through the function \id{IDASetStopTime} (see \S\ref{sss:optin_main}).
  \end{args}
}
{
  On return, \id{IDASolve} returns vectors \id{yret} and \id{ypret} and a
  corresponding  independent variable value $t=$\id{*tret}, such that (\id{yret},
  \id{ypret}) are the computed values of ($y(t)$, $y^\prime(t)$).

  In \id{IDA\_NORMAL} mode with no errors, \id{*tret} will be equal to \id{tout} 
  and \id{yret} = $y($\id{tout}$)$, \id{ypret} = $y^\prime($\id{tout}$)$.

  The return value \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) will be one of the following:
  \begin{args}[IDA\_TOO\_MUCH\_WORK]
  \item[\Id{IDA\_SUCCESS}]
    \id{IDASolve} succeeded.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_TSTOP\_RETURN}]
    \id{IDASolve} succeeded by reaching the stop point specified through
    the optional input function \id{IDASetStopTime}.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_ROOT\_RETURN}]
    \id{IDASolve} succeeded and found one or more roots.  If \id{nrtfn}
     $>1$, call \id{IDAGetRootInfo} to see which $g_i$ were found to
     have a root.  See \S\ref{s:using_rootfinding} for more information.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_MEM\_NULL}]
    The \id{ida\_mem} argument was \id{NULL}.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_ILL\_INPUT}]
    One of the inputs to \id{IDASolve} is illegal. This includes the situation where
    a root of one of the root functions was found both at a point $t$ and also
    very near $t$.  It also includes the situation when a 
    component of the error weight vectors becomes negative during internal 
    time-stepping. The \id{IDA\_ILL\_INPUT} flag will also be returned if the
    linear  solver function initialization (called by the user after calling 
    \id{IDACreate}) failed to set the linear solver-specific \id{lsolve} field
    in \id{ida\_mem}. 
    In any case, the user should see the printed error message for more details.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_TOO\_MUCH\_WORK}] 
    The solver took \id{mxstep} internal steps but could not reach tout. 
    The default value for \id{mxstep} is \id{MXSTEP\_DEFAULT = 500}.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_TOO\_MUCH\_ACC}] 
    The solver could not satisfy the accuracy demanded by the user for some 
    internal step.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_ERR\_FAIL}]
    Error test failures occurred too many times (\id{MXNEF = 10}) during one 
    internal time step or occurred with $|h| = h_{min}$.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_CONV\_FAIL}] 
    Convergence test failures occurred too many times (\id{MXNCF = 10}) during 
    one internal time step or occurred with $|h| = h_{min}$.             
  \item[\Id{IDA\_LINIT\_FAIL}]
    The linear solver's initialization function failed.   
  \item[\Id{IDA\_LSETUP\_FAIL}] 
    The linear solver's setup function failed in an unrecoverable manner.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_LSOLVE\_FAIL}] 
    The linear solver's solve function failed in an unrecoverable manner.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_CONSTR\_FAIL}]
    The inequality constraints were violated and the solver was unable
    to recover.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_REP\_RES\_ERR}]
    The user's residual function repeatedly returned a recoverable error
    flag, but the solver was unable to recover.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_RES\_FAIL}]
    The user's residual function returned a nonrecoverable error flag.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_RTFUNC\_FAIL}] 
    The rootfinding function failed.
  \end{args} 
}
{
  The vector \id{yret} can occupy the same space as the \id{y0} vector of 
  initial conditions that was passed to \id{IDAMalloc}, while the
  vector \id{ypret} can occupy the same space as the \id{yp0}.

  In the \id{IDA\_ONE\_STEP} mode, \id{tout} is used on the first call only, 
  to get the direction and rough scale of the independent variable.

  All failure return values are negative and therefore a test \id{flag} $< 0$
  will trap all \id{IDASolve} failures.

  On any error return in which one or more internal steps were taken by
  \id{IDASolve}, the returned values of \id{tret},\id{yret}, and \id{ypret}
  correspond to the farthest point reached in the integration.
  On all other error returns, these values are left unchanged from the
  previous \id{IDASolve} return.

\subsection{Optional input functions}\label{ss:optional_input}

{\ida} provides an extensive list of functions that can be used to change
various optional input parameters that control the
behavior of the {\ida} solver from their default values. 
Table \ref{t:optional_input} lists all optional input functions in {\ida} which 
are then described in detail in the remainder of this section.
For the most casual use of {\ida}, the reader can skip to \S\ref{ss:user_fct_sim}.

We note that, on error return, all these functions also send an error message to
the error handler function.
\index{error messages}
We also note that all error return values are negative, 
so a test \id{flag} $<0$ will catch any error.

\index{IDADENSE@{\idadense} linear solver!optional input|(}

{\idadense} solver needs a function to compute a dense approximation to
the Jacobian matrix $J(t,y,y^\prime)$.

The user can supply his/her own dense Jacobian function, or use the default 
difference quotient function \Id{IDADenseDQJac}

data \id{jac\_data}, {\idadense} provides the function \id{IDADenseSetJacFn}.
The {\idadense} solver passes the pointer \id{jac\_data}

create an arbitrary structure with relevant problem data and access it
during the execution of the user-supplied Jacobian function, without
using global data in the program.  The pointer \id{jac\_data} may be

\index{IDABAND@{\idaband} linear solver!optional input|(}
The \index{IDABAND@{\idaband} linear solver!Jacobian approximation used by}
{\idaband} solver needs a function to compute a banded approximation to the
Jacobian matrix $J(t,y,y^\prime)$. This function must be of type \id{IDABandJacFn}. 
The user can supply his/her own banded Jacobian approximation function, 
or use the default difference quotient function \Id{IDABandDQJac} 
\index{Jacobian approximation function!band!difference quotient}
that comes with the {\idaband} solver.
To specify a user-supplied Jacobian function \id{bjac} and associated user 
data \id{jac\_data}, {\idaband} provides the function \id{IDABandSetJacFn}.
The {\idaband} solver passes the pointer \id{jac\_data}
to its banded Jacobian approximation function. This allows the user to
create an arbitrary structure with relevant problem data and access it
during the execution of the user-supplied Jacobian function, without using
global data in the program.  The pointer \id{jac\_data} may be identical
to \id{res\_data}, if the latter was specified through \id{IDAodeSetFdata}.

The evaluation and preprocessing of any Jacobian-related data needed
by the user's preconditioner solve function is done in the optional
user-supplied function \id{psetup}. Both of these functions are
fully specified in \S\ref{ss:user_fct_sim}.
If used, the name of the \id{psetup} function should be specified in the call to
\id{IDASpilsSetPreconditioner}.

Optionally, the pointer \id{p\_data} received through \id{IDASpilsSetPreconditioner}

  In terms of the problem size $N$, the maximum method order \id{maxord}, and
  the number \id{nrtfn} of root functions (see \S\ref{s:using_rootfinding}),
  the actual size of the real workspace, in \id{realtype} words, is
  given by the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item base value: \id{lenrw} $= 55 + (m + 6)*N_r + 3*$\id{nrtfn};
  \item with \id{itol = IDA\_SV}: \id{lenrw} $=$ \id{lenrw} $+ N_r$;
  \item with constraint checking (see \id{IDASetConstraints}): 
    \id{lenrw} $=$ \id{lenrw} $+ N_r$;
  \item with \id{id} specified (see \id{IDASetId}): 
    \id{lenrw} $=$ \id{lenrw} $+ N_r$;
  \end{itemize}
  where $m = \max($\id{maxord}$,3)$, and
  $N_r$ is the number of real words in one \id{N\_Vector} ($\approx N$).

  The size of the integer workspace (without distinction between \id{int} 
  and \id{long int} words) is given by:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item base value: \id{leniw} $= 38 + (m + 6)*N_i ~ + ~ $\id{nrtfn};  
  \item with \id{itol = IDA\_SV}: \id{leniw} $=$ \id{leniw} $+ N_i$;

  \item with \id{id} specified: \id{lenrw} $=$ \id{lenrw} $+ N_i$;

  where $N_i$ is the number of integer words in one \id{N\_Vector}
  (= 1 for {\nvecs} and 2*\id{npes} for {\nvecp} on \id{npes} processors).

  For the default value of \id{maxord}, with no rootfinding, no \id{id},
  no constraints, and with \id{itol} $\neq$ \id{IDA\_SV}, these lengths are
  given roughly by: \id{lenrw} $= 55 + 11N$, \id{leniw} $= 38$.

otherwise conflict with the name of an optional output from the main
solver, a suffix \id{LS} (for Linear Solver) has been added here (e.g.
\id{lenrwLS}).

\subsection{IDA reinitialization function}\label{sss:idareinit}
\index{reinitialization}

The function \ID{IDAReInit} reinitializes the main {\ida} solver for
the solution of a problem, where a prior call to \Id{IDAMalloc} has
been made. The new problem must have the same size as the previous one.
\id{IDAReInit} performs the same input checking and initializations 
that \id{IDAMalloc} does, but does no memory allocation, assuming that the 
existing internal memory is sufficient for the new problem.             
                                                                 
The use of \id{IDAReInit} requires that the maximum method order,    
\Id{maxord}, is no larger for the new problem than for the problem  
specified in the last call to \id{IDAMalloc}.  In addition, the same
{\nvector} module set for the previous problem
will be reused for the new problem.

If there are changes to the linear solver specifications, make the
appropriate \id{Set} calls, as described in \S\ref{sss:lin_solv_init}.

    is the initial value of $y^\prime$.   
  \item[itol] (\id{int}) 
    is one of \Id{IDA\_SS}, \Id{IDA\_SV}, or \Id{IDA\_WF}, where \id{IDA\_SS}
    indicates scalar relative error tolerance and scalar absolute error tolerance, 
    while \id{IDA\_SV} indicates scalar relative error tolerance and vector 
    absolute error tolerance.  The latter choice is important when the absolute 
    error tolerance needs to be different for each component of the DAE.  If

\section{User-supplied functions}\label{ss:user_fct_sim}
%%===================================================================================

The user-supplied functions consist of one function defining the DAE residual,
(optionally) a function that provides the error weight vector,
(optionally) a function that provides Jacobian-related information for the linear 
solver (if Newton iteration is chosen), and (optionally) one or two functions 
that define the preconditioner for use in any of the Krylov iteration algorithms.
%%
%%--------------
%%
\subsection{Residual function}\label{ss:resFn}
\index{residual function}
The user must provide a function of type \ID{IDAResFn} defined as follows:
\usfunction{IDAResFn}
{
  typedef int (*IDAResFn)(&realtype tt, N\_Vector yy, N\_Vector yp,  \\
                          &N\_Vector rr, void *res\_data);
}
{
  This function computes the problem residual for given values
  of the independent variable $t$, state vector $y$, and derivative $y^\prime$.
}
{
  \begin{args}[res\_data]
  \item[tt]
    is the current value of the independent variable.
  \item[yy]
    is the current value of the dependent variable vector, $y(t)$.
  \item[yp]
    is the current value of $y'(t)$.
  \item[rr]
    is the output residual vector $F(t,y,y')$.
  \item[res\_data]
    is a pointer to user data --- the same as the \Id{res\_data}      
    parameter passed to \id{IDASetRdata}.   
  \end{args}
}
{
  An \id{IDAResFn} function type should return a value of $0$ if successful, 
  a positive value if a recoverable error occured (e.g. \id{yy} has an illegal
  value), or a negative value if a nonrecoverable error occured. 

  In the latter case, the integrator halts. 
  If a recoverable error occured, the integrator will attempt to correct and retry.
}
{
  Allocation of memory for \id{yp} is handled within {\ida}.
}
%%
%%--------------
%%
\subsection{Error message handler function}
\label{ss:ehFn}
\index{error messages!user-defined handler}
As an alternative to the default behavior of directing error and warning messages 
to the file pointed to by \id{errfp} (see \id{IDASetErrFile}), the user may
provide a function of type \ID{IDAErrHandlerFn} to process any such messages.
The function type \id{IDAErrHandlerFn} is defined as follows:
\usfunction{IDAErrHandlerFn}
{
  typedef void (*IDAErrHandlerFn)(&int error\_code,  \\
                                  &const char *module, const char *function, \\ 
                                  &char *msg, void *eh\_data); 
}
{
  This function processes error and warning messages from {\ida} and 
  its sub-modules.
}
{
  \begin{args}[error\_code]
  \item[error\_code]
    is the error code.
  \item[module]
    is the name of the {\ida} module reporting the error.
  \item[function]
    is the name of the function in which the error occurred.
  \item[msg]
    is the error message.
  \item[eh\_data]
    is a pointer to user data, the same as the \Id{eh\_data}      
    parameter passed to \id{IDASetErrHandlerFn}.   
  \end{args}
}
{
  A \id{IDAErrHandlerFn} function has no return value.
}
{
  \id{error\_code} is negative for errors and positive (\Id{IDA\_WARNING}) for warnings.
  If a function returning a pointer to memory (e.g. \id{IDABBDPrecAlloc}) encounters an
  error, it sets \id{error\_code} to 0 before returning \id{NULL}.
}
%%
%%--------------
%%
\subsection{Error weight function}
\label{ss:ewtsetFn}
\index{tolerances}
As an alternative to providing the relative and absolute tolerances, the user may
provide a function of type \ID{IDAEwtFn} to compute a vector \id{ewt} containing the
multiplicative weights $W_i$ used in the WRMS norm 
$\|\ v \|_{\mbox{\scriptsize WRMS}} = \sqrt{(1/N)\sum_1^N (W_i \cdot v_i)^2}$.
These weights will used in place of those defined by Eq. (\ref{e:errwt}).
The function type \id{IDAEwtFn} is defined as follows:

\subsection{Jacobian information (direct method with dense Jacobian)}

If the direct linear solver with dense treatment of the Jacobian is used (i.e. 
\Id{IDADense} is called in Step \ref{i:lin_solver} of \S\ref{ss:skeleton_sim}), 
the user may provide a function of type \ID{IDADenseJacFn} defined by
\usfunction{IDADenseJacFn}
{
  typedef int (*IDADenseJacFn&)(long int Neq, realtype tt, \\

{
  This function computes the dense Jacobian $J$ of the DAE system (or an
  approximation to it), defined by Eq. (\ref{e:DAE_Jacobian}).
  
}
{
  \begin{args}[jac\_data]
  \item[Neq]
    is the problem size (number of equations).
  \item[tt]
    is the current value of the independent variable $t$.
  \item[yy]
    is the current value of the dependent variable vector, $y(t)$.
  \item[yp]
    is the current value of $y'(t)$.
  \item[rr]
    is the current value of the residual vector $F(t,y,y')$.
  \item[c\_j]
    is the scalar in the system Jacobian, proportional to the inverse of the
    step size ($\alpha$ in Eq. (\ref{e:DAE_Jacobian}) ).
  \item[jac\_data]
    is a pointer to user data --- the same as the \id{jac\_data}      
    parameter passed to \id{IDADenseSetJacData}.   
  \item[Jac]
    is the output Jacobian matrix.  
  \item[tmp1]
  \item[tmp2]
  \item[tmp3]
    are pointers to memory allocated for variables of type \id{N\_Vector} 
    which can be used by \id{IDADenseJacFn} as temporary storage or work space.
  \end{args}
}
{
  An \id{IDADenseJacFn} function type should return $0$ if successful,
  a positive value if a recoverable error occured, or a negative value
  if a nonrecoverable error occured. 

  In the case of a recoverable eror return, 
  the integrator will attempt to recover by reducing the stepsize,
  and hence changing $\alpha$ in (\ref{e:DAE_Jacobian}).
}
{
  A user-supplied dense Jacobian function must load the \id{Neq} $\times$ \id{Neq}
  dense matrix \id{Jac} with an approximation to the Jacobian matrix $J$
  at the point (\id{tt}, \id{yy}, \id{yp}).  Only nonzero elements need to be loaded
  into \id{Jac} because \id{Jac} is set to the zero matrix before the call
  to the Jacobian function. The type of \id{Jac} is \Id{DenseMat} 
  (described below and in \S\ref{ss:dense}). 
  
  The accessor macros \Id{DENSE\_ELEM} and \Id{DENSE\_COL} allow the user to
  read and write dense matrix elements without making explicit
  references to the underlying representation of the \id{DenseMat}
  type. \id{DENSE\_ELEM(Jac, i, j)} references the (\id{i}, \id{j})-th
  element of the dense matrix \id{Jac} (\id{i}, \id{j}$= 0\ldots$ \id{Neq}$-1$).
  This macro is for use in small problems in which efficiency of access is not a
  major concern.  Thus, in terms of indices $m$ and $n$ running from $1$ to
  \id{Neq}, the Jacobian element $J_{m,n}$ can be loaded with the statement
  \id{DENSE\_ELEM(Jac, m-1, n-1) =} $J_{m,n}$.  Alternatively,
  \id{DENSE\_COL(Jac, j)} returns a pointer to the storage for
  the \id{j}th column of \id{Jac} (\id{j}$= 0\ldots$ \id{Neq}$-1$), and the 
  elements of the \id{j}-th column
  are then accessed via ordinary array indexing.  Thus $J_{m,n}$ can be 
  loaded with the statements \id{col\_n = DENSE\_COL(Jac, n-1);}
  \id{col\_n[m-1] =} $J_{m,n}$.  For large problems, it is more 
  efficient to use \id{DENSE\_COL} than to use \id{DENSE\_ELEM}. 
  Note that both of these macros number rows and columns
  starting from $0$, not $1$.  

  The \id{DenseMat} type and the accessor macros \id{DENSE\_ELEM} and 
  \id{DENSE\_COL} are documented in \S\ref{ss:dense}.

  If the user's \id{IDADenseJacFn} function uses difference quotient approximations,
  it may need to access quantities not in the call list. These include the current
  stepsize, the error weights, etc. To obtain these, use the \id{IDAGet*} functions 
  described in \S\ref{sss:optout_main}. The unit roundoff can be accessed
  as \id{UNIT\_ROUNDOFF} defined in \id{sundials\_types.h}.

If the direct linear solver with banded treatment of the Jacobian is used (i.e.
\Id{IDABand} is called in Step \ref{i:lin_solver} of \S\ref{ss:skeleton_sim}), 
the user may provide a function of type \ID{IDABandJacFn} defined as follows:
\usfunction{IDABandJacFn}
{
 typedef int (*IDABandJacFn)(&long int Neq, long int mupper, \\
                             &long int mlower, realtype tt, \\

                             &N\_Vector tmp1, N\_Vector tmp2,N\_Vector tmp3);
}
{
  This function computes the banded Jacobian $J$ of the DAE system (or a banded
  approximation to it), defined by Eq. (\ref{e:DAE_Jacobian}).

}
{
  \begin{args}[jac\_data]
  \item[Neq]
    is the problem size.
  \item[mlower]
  \item[mupper]
    are the lower and upper half bandwidth of the Jacobian.
  \item[tt]
    is the current value of the independent variable.
  \item[yy]
    is the current value of the dependent variable vector, $y(t)$.
  \item[yp]
    is the current value of $y'(t)$.
  \item[rr]
    is the current value of the residual vector $F(t,y,y')$.
  \item[c\_j]
    is the scalar in the system Jacobian, proportional to the inverse of the
    step size ($\alpha$ in Eq. (\ref{e:DAE_Jacobian}) ).
  \item[jac\_data]
    is a pointer to user data --- the same as the \id{jac\_data}      
    parameter passed to \id{IDABandSetJacData}.   
  \item[Jac]
    is the output Jacobian matrix.  
  \item[tmp1]
  \item[tmp2]
  \item[tmp3]
    are pointers to memory allocated for variables of type \id{N\_Vector} 
    which can be used by \id{IDABandJacFn} as temporary storage or work space.    
  \end{args}
}
{
  A \id{IDABandJacFn} function type should return $0$ if successful,
  a positive value if a recoverable error occured, or a negative value
  if a nonrecoverable error occured. 

  In the case of a recoverable eror return, 
  the integrator will attempt to recover by reducing the stepsize,
  and hence changing $\alpha$ in (\ref{e:DAE_Jacobian}).
}
{
  A user-supplied band Jacobian function must load the band matrix \id{Jac}
  of type \Id{BandMat} with the elements of the Jacobian $J(t,y,y^\prime)$ at the
  point (\id{tt}, \id{yy}, \id{yp}).  Only nonzero elements need to be loaded into
  \id{Jac} because \id{Jac} is preset to zero before the call to the
  Jacobian function.  

  The accessor macros \Id{BAND\_ELEM}, \Id{BAND\_COL}, and \Id{BAND\_COL\_ELEM} 
  allow the user to read and write band matrix elements without making specific 
  references to the underlying representation of the \id{BandMat} type.
  \id{BAND\_ELEM(Jac, i, j)} references the (\id{i}, \id{j})th element of the 
  band matrix \id{Jac}, counting from $0$.
  This macro is for use in small problems in which efficiency of access is not
  a major concern.  Thus, in terms of indices $m$ and $n$ running from $1$ to
  \id{Neq} with $(m,n)$ within the band defined by \id{mupper} and
  \id{mlower}, the Jacobian element $J_{m,n}$ can be loaded with the 
  statement \id{BAND\_ELEM(Jac, m-1, n-1) =} $J_{m,n}$. The elements within
  the band are those with \id{-mupper} $\le$ \id{m-n} $\le$ \id{mlower}.
  Alternatively, \id{BAND\_COL(Jac, j)} returns a pointer to the diagonal element
  of the \id{j}th column of \id{Jac}, and if we assign this address to 
  \id{realtype *col\_j}, then the \id{i}th element of the \id{j}th column is
  given by \id{BAND\_COL\_ELEM(col\_j, i, j)}, counting from $0$.
  Thus for $(m,n)$ within the band, $J_{m,n}$ can be loaded by setting 
  \id{col\_n = BAND\_COL(Jac, n-1);} \id{BAND\_COL\_ELEM(col\_n, m-1, n-1) =} $J_{m,n}$.
  The elements of the \id{j}th column can also be accessed
  via ordinary array indexing, but this approach requires knowledge of
  the underlying storage for a band matrix of type \id{BandMat}.  
  The array \id{col\_n} can be indexed from $-$\id{mupper} to \id{mlower}.
  For large problems, it is more efficient to use the combination of
  \id{BAND\_COL} and \id{BAND\_COL\_ELEM} than to use the
  \id{BAND\_ELEM}.  As in the dense case, these macros all number rows
  and columns starting from $0$, not $1$.  

  The \id{BandMat} type and the accessor macros \id{BAND\_ELEM}, \id{BAND\_COL}, and
  \id{BAND\_COL\_ELEM} are documented in \S\ref{ss:band}.

  If the user's \id{IDABandJacFn} function uses difference quotient approximations,
  it may need to access quantities not in the call list. These include the current
  stepsize, the error weights, etc. To obtain these, use the \id{IDAGet*} functions 
  described in \S\ref{sss:optout_main}. The unit roundoff can be accessed

  function, but rather is called only as often as needed to achieve convergence in
  the Newton iteration.

  approximations, it may need to access quantities not in the call
  list. These include the current stepsize, the error weights, etc.

\subsection{User-supplied function for rootfinding}\label{ss:root_us}

If a rootfinding problem is to be solved during the integration of the ODE system,
the user must supply a {\C} function of type \ID{IDARootFn}, defined as follows:
%%
\usfunction{IDARootFn}
{
  typedef int (*IDARootFn)(&realtype t, N\_Vector y, N\_Vector yp, \\
                           &realtype *gout, void *g\_data);

{
  This function computes a vector-valued function $g(t,y,y')$ such that the
  roots of the \id{nrtfn} components $g_i(t,y,y')$ are to be found during
  the integration.
}
{
  \begin{args}[g\_data]
  \item[t]
    is the current value of the independent variable.
  \item[y]
    is the current value of the dependent variable vector, $y(t)$.
  \item[yp]
    is the current value of $y'(t)$, the $t-$derivative of $y$.
  \item[gout]
    is the output array, of length \id{nrtfn}, with components $g_i(t,y,y')$.
  \item[g\_data]
    is a pointer to user data --- the same as the \Id{g\_data}      
    parameter passed to \id{IDARootInit}.   
  \end{args}

{
  An \id{IDARootFn} should return 0 if successful or a non-zero value if
  an error occured (in which case the integration is halted and \id{IDASolve} returns
  \Id{IDA\_RTFUNC\_FAIL}).
}
{
  Allocation of memory for \id{gout} is handled within {\ida}.

\section{A parallel band-block-diagonal preconditioner module}\label{sss:idabbdpre}
%%===================================================================================

A principal reason for using a parallel DAE solver such as {\ida} lies
in the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs).  Moreover,
the use of a Krylov iterative method for the solution of many such
problems is motivated by the nature of the underlying linear system of
equations (\ref{e:DAE_Newtoncorr}) that must be solved at each time step.  The
linear algebraic system is large, sparse, and structured. However, if
a Krylov iterative method is to be effective in this setting, then a
nontrivial preconditioner needs to be used.  Otherwise, the rate of
convergence of the Krylov iterative method is usually unacceptably
slow.  Unfortunately, an effective preconditioner tends to be
problem-specific.

However, we have developed one type of preconditioner that treats a
rather broad class of PDE-based problems.  It has been successfully
used for several realistic, large-scale problems \cite{HiTa:98} and is
included in a software module within the {\ida} package. This module
works with the parallel vector module {\nvecp} and 
generates a preconditioner that is a block-diagonal matrix with each
block being a band matrix. The blocks need not have the same number of
super- and sub-diagonals and these numbers may vary from block to
block. This Band-Block-Diagonal Preconditioner module is called
{\idabbdpre}.

\index{IDABBDPRE@{\idabbdpre} preconditioner!description|(}
\index{preconditioning!band-block diagonal}
One way to envision these preconditioners is to think of the domain of
the computational PDE problem as being subdivided into $M$ non-overlapping
sub-domains.  Each of these sub-domains is then assigned to one of the
$M$ processors to be used to solve the DAE system. The basic idea is
to isolate the preconditioning so that it is local to each processor,
and also to use a (possibly cheaper) approximate residual
function. This requires the definition of a new function $G(t,y,y^\prime)$
which approximates the function $F(t, y, y^\prime)$ in the definition of the DAE
system (\ref{e:DAE}). However, the user may set $G = F$.  Corresponding
to the domain decomposition, there is a decomposition of the solution
vectors $y$ and $y'$ into $M$ disjoint blocks $y_m$ and $y'_m$, and a
decomposition of $G$ into blocks $G_m$.  The block $G_m$ depends on $y_m$
and $y'_m$, and also on components of $y_{m'}$ and $y'_{m'}$ associated with
neighboring sub-domains (so-called ghost-cell data).  Let $\bar{y}_m$
and $\bar{y'}_m$ denote $y_m$ and $y'_m$ (respectively) augmented
with those other components on which $G_m$ depends.  Then we have
\begin{equation}
  G(t,y,y') = [G_1(t,\bar{y}_1,\bar{y}'_1), G_2(t,\bar{y}_2,\bar{y}'_2),
               \ldots, G_M(t,\bar{y}_M,\bar{y}'_M)]^T ~,
\end{equation}
and each of the blocks $G_m(t,\bar{y}_m,\bar{y}'_m)$ is uncoupled from
the others.

The preconditioner associated with this decomposition has the form 
\begin{equation}
  P= diag[P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_M]
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
  P_m \approx \partial G_m / \partial y_m
  + \alpha \partial G_m / \partial y^\prime_m
\end{equation}
This matrix is taken to be banded, with
upper and lower half-bandwidths \id{mudq} and \id{mldq} defined as
the number of non-zero diagonals above and below the main diagonal,
respectively. The difference quotient approximation is computed using
\id{mudq} $+$ \id{mldq} $+ 2$ evaluations of $G_m$, but only a matrix
of bandwidth \id{mukeep} $+$ \id{mlkeep} $+ 1$ is retained.

Neither pair of parameters need be the true half-bandwidths of the Jacobians
of the local block of $G$, if smaller values provide a more efficient
preconditioner.  Such an efficiency gain may occur if the couplings
in the DAE system outside a certain bandwidth are considerably weaker than
those within the band.  Reducing \id{mukeep} and \id{mlkeep} while keeping
\id{mudq} and \id{mldq} at their true values, discards the elements
outside the narrower band.  Reducing both pairs has the additional
effect of lumping the outer Jacobian elements into the computed elements
within the band, and requires more caution and experimentation.

The solution of the complete linear system
\begin{equation}
  Px = b
\end{equation}
reduces to solving each of the equations 
\begin{equation}
  P_m x_m = b_m
\end{equation}
and this is done by banded LU factorization of $P_m$ followed by a banded
backsolve.
\index{IDABBDPRE@{\idabbdpre} preconditioner!description|)}

Similar block-diagonal preconditioners could be considered with different
treatment of the blocks $P_m$. For example, incomplete LU factorization or
an iterative method could be used instead of banded LU factorization.

The {\idabbdpre} module calls two user-provided functions to construct $P$: 
a required function \id{Gres} (of type \id{IDABBDLocalFn}) which approximates
the residual function $G(t,y,y') \approx F(t,y,y')$ and which is computed locally,
and an optional function \id{Gcomm} (of type \id{IDABBDCommFn}) which performs
all inter-process communication necessary to evaluate the approximate residual $G$.
These are in addition to the user-supplied residual function \id{res}.
Both functions take as input the same pointer \id{res\_data} as passed
by the user to \id{IDASetRdata} and passed to the user's function \id{res},
and neither function has a return value. The user is responsible for
providing space (presumably within \id{res\_data}) for components of \id{yy}
and \id{yp} that are communicated by \id{Gcomm} from the other processors, and that
are then used by \id{Gres}, which is not expected to do any communication.

}
{
  An \id{IDABBDCommFn} function type should return 0 to indicate success,
  1 for a recoverable error, or -1 for a non-recoverable error.
}
{
  The \id{Gcomm} function is expected to save communicated data in space defined
  within the structure \id{res\_data}. 

  Each call to the \id{Gcomm} function is preceded by a call to the residual
  function \id{res} with the same (\id{tt}, \id{yy}, \id{yp}) arguments.  
  Thus \id{Gcomm} can omit any communications done by \id{res} if relevant to the 
  evaluation of \id{Gres}.  
  If all necessary comunication was done in \id{res}, then \id{Gcomm} $=$ \id{NULL}
  can be passed in the call to \id{IDABBDPrecAlloc} (see below).

\ucfunction{IDABBDPrecGetWorkSpace}
{
  flag = IDABBDPrecGetWorkSpace(bbd\_data, \&lenrwBBDP, \&leniwBBDP);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDABBDPrecGetWorkSpace} returns the local sizes
  of the {\idabbdpre} real and integer workspaces.
}
{
  \begin{args}[lenrwBBDP]
  \item[bbd\_data] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the {\idabbdpre} data structure.
  \item[lenrwBBDP] (\id{long int})
    local number of real values in the {\idabbdpre} workspace.
  \item[leniwBBDP] (\id{long int})
    local number of integer values in the {\idabbdpre} workspace.
  \end{args}
}
{
  The return value \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) is one of
  \begin{args}[IDABBDPRE\_PDATA\_NULL]
  \item[IDABBDPRE\_SUCCESS] 
    The optional output value has been successfuly set.
  \item[\Id{IDABBDPRE\_PDATA\_NULL}]
    The {\idabbdpre} preconditioner has not been initialized.
  \end{args}

{
  In terms of the local vector dimension $N_l$, and
  \id{smu} = $\min ( N_l - 1 ,$ \id{mukeep} $+$ \id{mlkeep}$)$,
  the actual size of the real workspace is
  $N_l \,(2$ \id{mlkeep} $+$ \id{mukeep} $+$ \id{smu} $+2)$ \id{realtype} words.
  The actual size of the integer workspace is $N_l$ integer words.

  The return value \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) is one of
  \begin{args}[IDABBDPRE\_PDATA\_NULL]
  \item[IDABBDPRE\_SUCCESS]

In addition to the \id{ngevalsBBDP} \id{Gres} evaluations,
the costs associated with {\idabbdpre} also include \id{nlinsetups} LU
factorizations, \id{nlinsetups} calls to \id{Gcomm}, \id{npsolves} banded
backsolve calls, and \id{nrevalsLS} residual function evaluations,
where \id{nlinsetups} is an optional {\ida} output (see
\S\ref{sss:optout_main}), and \id{npsolves} and \id{nrevalsLS} are
linear solver optional outputs (see \S\ref{sss:optout_linsol}).
