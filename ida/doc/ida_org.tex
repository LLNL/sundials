\index{IDA@{\ida}!package structure}
The {\ida} package is written in the ANSI {\C} language. The following
summarizes the basic structure of the package, although knowledge
of this structure is not necessary for its use.

The overall organization of the {\ida} package is shown in Figure
\ref{f:idaorg}.

The central integration module, implemented in the files 
\id{ida.h} and \id{ida.c}, deals with the evaluation of integration coefficients,
the Newton iteration process, estimation of local error,
selection of stepsize and order, and interpolation to user output
points, among other issues.  Although this module contains logic for
the basic Newton iteration algorithm, it has no knowledge of the
method being used to solve the linear systems that arise.  For any
given user problem, one of the linear system modules is specified, and
is then invoked as needed during the integration. 

\index{IDA@{\ida} linear solvers!list of|(} 
At present, the package includes the following three {\ida} linear system
modules:
\begin{itemize} 
\item {\idadense}: LU factorization and backsolving with dense matrices; 
\item {\idaband}: LU factorization and backsolving with banded matrices; 
\item {\idaspgmr}: scaled preconditioned GMRES method.
\end{itemize}
This set of linear solver modules is intended to be expanded in the
future as new algorithms are developed.
\index{IDA@{\ida} linear solvers!list of|)} 

In the case of the direct {\idadense} and {\idaband} methods, the package includes
an algorithm for the approximation of the Jacobian by difference
quotients, but the user also has the option of supplying the Jacobian
(or an approximation to it) directly. In the case of the iterative
{\idaspgmr} method, the package includes and algorithm for the approximation
by difference quotients of the product between the Jacobian matrix and
a vector of appropriate length. Again, the user has the option of providing
a routine for this operation.
In \index{preconditioning!setup and solve phases} the case of {\idaspgmr}, 
the preconditioning must be supplied by the user, in two phases: 
setup (preprocessing of Jacobian data) and solve.
While\index{preconditioning!advice on} there is no default
choice of preconditioner analogous to the difference quotient
approximation in the direct case, the references
\cite{BrHi:89}-\cite{Byr:92}, together with
the example and demonstration programs included with {\ida}, offer
considerable assistance in building preconditioners.

\index{IDA@{\ida} linear solvers!implementation details|(} 
Each {\ida} linear solver module consists of four routines, devoted to (1)
memory allocation and initialization, (2) setup of the matrix data
involved, (3) solution of the system, and (4) freeing of memory.  
The setup and solution phases are separate because the evaluation of
Jacobians and preconditioners is done only periodically during the
integration, as required to achieve convergence. The call list within
the central {\ida} module to each of the five associated functions is
fixed, thus allowing the central module to be completely independent
of the linear system method.
\index{IDA@{\ida} linear solvers!implementation details|)} 

These modules are also decomposed in another way.
\index{generic linear solvers!use in {\ida}|(} 
Each of the modules {\idadense}, {\idaband}, and {\idaspgmr} is a set of 
interface routines built on top of a generic solver module, 
named {\dense}, {\band}, and {\spgmr}, respectively.  
The interfaces deal with the use of these methods in the {\ida} context, 
whereas the generic solver is independent of the context.
While the generic solvers here were generated with {\sundials} in mind, our
intention is that they be usable in other applications as
general-purpose solvers.  This separation also allows for any generic
solver to be replaced by an improved version, with no necessity to
revise the {\ida} package elsewhere.
\index{generic linear solvers!use in {\ida}|)}

{\ida} also provides a preconditioner module,
{\idabbdpre}, that works in conjunction with {\nvecp} and generates a 
preconditioner that is a block-diagonal matrix with each block being 
a band matrix.

All state information used by {\ida} to solve a given problem is saved
in a structure, and a pointer to that structure is returned to the
user.  There is no global data in the {\ida} package, and so in this
respect it is reentrant. State information specific to the linear
solver is saved in separate structure, a pointer to which resides in
the {\ida} memory structure. The reentrancy of {\ida} was motivated
by the anticipated multicomputer extension, but is also essential
in a uniprocessor setting where two or more problems are solved by
intermixed calls to the package from one user program.
