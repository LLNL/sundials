 * ==============================================================================
 *
 *                   FCVBBD Interface Package
 * 
 * The FCVBBD Interface Package is a package of C functions which,
 * together with the FCVODE Interface Package, support the use of the
 * CVODE solver (parallel MPI version) with the CVBBDPRE preconditioner module,
 * for the solution of ODE systems in a mixed Fortran/C setting.  The
 * combination of CVODE and CVBBDPRE solves systems dy/dt = f(t,y) with
 * the SPGMR (scaled preconditioned GMRES) method for the linear systems
 * that arise, and with a preconditioner that is block-diagonal with
 * banded blocks.  While CVODE and CVBBDPRE are written in C, it is
 * assumed here that the user's calling program and user-supplied
 * problem-defining routines are written in Fortran.
 * 
 * The user-callable functions in this package, with the corresponding
 * CVODE and CVBBDPRE functions, are as follows: 
 *   FCVBBDININT  interfaces to CVBBDPrecAlloc and CVSpgmr 
 *   FCVBBDREINIT interfaces to CVBBDPrecReInit
 *   FCVBBDOPT    accesses optional outputs
 *   FCVBBDFREE   interfaces to CVBBDPrecFree
 * 
 * In addition to the Fortran right-hand side function FCVFUN, the
 * user-supplied functions used by this package, are listed below,
 * each with the corresponding interface function which calls it (and its
 * type within CVBBDPRE or CVODE):
 *   FCVLOCFN  is called by the interface function FCVgloc of type CVLocalFn
 *   FCVCOMMF  is called by the interface function FCVcfn of type CVCommFn
 *   FCVJTIMES (optional) is called by the interface function FCVJtimes of 
 *             type CVSpgmrJtimesFn
 * (The names of all user-supplied routines here are fixed, in order to
 * maximize portability for the resulting mixed-language program.)
 * 
 * Important note on portability.
 * In this package, the names of the interface functions, and the names of
 * the Fortran user routines called by them, appear as dummy names
 * which are mapped to actual values by a series of definitions in the
 * header file fcvbbd.h. These definition depend in turn on variables
 * SUNDIALS_UNDERSCORE_NONE and SUNDIALS_UNDERSCORE_TWO which can be 
 * set at the configuration stage.
 * 
 * ==============================================================================
 * 
 *               Usage of the FCVODE/FCVBBD Interface Packages
 * 
 * The usage of the combined interface packages FCVODE and FCVBBD requires
 * calls to seven to twelve interface functions, and three or four user-supplied
 * routines which define the problem to be solved and indirectly define
 * the preconditioner.  These function calls and user routines are
 * summarized separately below.
 * 
 * Some details are omitted, and the user is referred to the CVODE user document 
 * for more complete information.
 * 
 * (1) User-supplied right-hand side routine: FCVFUN
 * The user must in all cases supply the following Fortran routine
 *       SUBROUTINE FCVFUN (T, Y, YDOT)
 *       DIMENSION Y(*), YDOT(*)
 * It must set the YDOT array to f(t,y), the right-hand side of the ODE
 * system, as function of T = t and the array Y = y.  Here Y and YDOT
 * are distributed vectors.
 * 
 * (2) User-supplied routines to define preconditoner: FCVLOCFN and FCVCOMMF
 * 
 * The routines in the CVBBDPRE module provide a preconditioner matrix
 * for CVODE that is block-diagonal with banded blocks.  The blocking
 * corresponds to the distribution of the dependent variable vector y
 * among the processors.  Each preconditioner block is generated from the
 * Jacobian of the local part (on the current processor) of a given
 * function g(t,y) approximating f(t,y).  The blocks are generated by a
 * difference quotient scheme on each processor independently, utilizing
 * an assumed banded structure with given half-bandwidths.  A separate
 * pair of half-bandwidths defines the band matrix retained.
 * 
 * (2.1) Local approximate function FCVLOCFN.
 * The user must supply a subroutine of the form
 *       SUBROUTINE FCVLOCFN (NLOC, T, YLOC, GLOC)
 *       DIMENSION YLOC(*), GLOC(*)
 * to compute the function g(t,y) which approximates the right-hand side
 * function f(t,y).  This function is to be computed locally, i.e. without 
 * inter-processor communication.  (The case where g is mathematically
 * identical to f is allowed.)  It takes as input the local vector length
 * NLOC, the independent variable value T = t, and the local realtype
 * dependent variable array YLOC.  It is to compute the local part of
 * g(t,y) and store this in the realtype array GLOC.
 * 
 * (2.2) Communication function FCVCOMMF.
 * The user must also supply a subroutine of the form
 *       SUBROUTINE FCVCOMMF (NLOC, T, YLOC)
 *       DIMENSION YLOC(*)
 * which is to perform all inter-processor communication necessary to
 * evaluate the approximate right-hand side function g described above.
 * This function takes as input the local vector length NLOC, the
 * independent variable value T = t, and the local real dependent
 * variable array YLOC.  It is expected to save communicated data in 
 * work space defined by the user, and made available to CVLOCFN.
 * Each call to the FCVCOMMF is preceded by a call to FCVFUN with the same
 * (t,y) arguments.  Thus FCVCOMMF can omit any communications done by 
 * FCVFUN if relevant to the evaluation of g.
 * 
 * (3) Optional user-supplied Jacobian-vector product routine: FCVJTIMES
 * As an option, the user may supply a routine that computes the product
 * of the system Jacobian J = df/dy and a given vector v.  If supplied, it
 * must have the following form:
 *       SUBROUTINE FCVJTIMES (V, FJV, T, Y, FY, EWT, WORK, IER)
 *       DIMENSION V(*), FJV(*), Y(*), FY(*), EWT(*), WORK(*)
 * Typically this routine will use only NEQ, T, Y, V, and FJV.  It must
 * compute the product vector Jv, where the vector v is stored in V, and store
 * the product in FJV.  On return, set IER = 0 if FCVJTIMES was successful,
 * and nonzero otherwise.
 * 
 * (4) Initialization:  FNVINITP, FCVMALLOC, FCVBBDINIT.
 * 
 * (4.1) To initialize the parallel vector specification, the user must make 
 * the following call:
 *        CALL FNVINITP (NLOCAL, NGLOBAL, IER)
 * The arguments are:
 * NLOCAL  = local size of vectors on this processor
 * NGLOBAL = the system size, and the global size of vectors (the sum 
 *           of all values of NLOCAL)
 * IER     = return completion flag. Values are 0 = success, -1 = failure.
 * 
 * Note: If MPI was initialized by the user, the communicator must be
 * set to MPI_COMM_WORLD.  If not, this routine initializes MPI and sets
 * the communicator equal to MPI_COMM_WORLD.
 * 
 * (4.2) To set various problem and solution parameters and allocate
 * internal memory for CVODE, make the following call:
 *       CALL FCVMALLOC(T0, Y0, METH, ITMETH, IATOL, RTOL, ATOL, INOPT,
 *      1               IOPT, ROPT, IER)
 * The arguments are:
 * T0     = initial value of t
 * Y0     = array of initial conditions
 * METH   = basic integration method: 1 = Adams (nonstiff), 2 = BDF (stiff)
 * ITMETH = nonlinear iteration method: 1 = functional iteration, 2 = Newton iter.
 * IATOL  = type for absolute tolerance ATOL: 1 = scalar, 2 = array
 * RTOL   = relative tolerance (scalar)
 * ATOL   = absolute tolerance (scalar or array)
 * INOPT  = optional input flag: 0 = none, 1 = inputs used
 * IOPT   = array of length 40 for integer optional inputs and outputs
 *          (declare as INTEGER*4 or INTEGER*8 according to C type long int)
 * ROPT   = array of length 40 for real optional inputs and outputs
 *          The optional inputs are MAXORD, MXSTEP, MXHNIL, SLDET, H0, HMAX,
 *          HMIN, stored in IOPT(1), IOPT(2), IOPT(3), IOPT(14), ROPT(1),
 *          ROPT(2), ROPT(3), respectively.  If any of these optional inputs
 *          are used, set the others to zero to indicate default values.
 *          The optional outputs are NST, NFE, NSETUPS, NNI, NCFN, NETF, QU, QCUR,
 *          LENRW, LENIW, NOR, HU, HCUR, TCUR, TOLSF, stored in IOPT(4) .. IOPT(13),
 *          IOPT(15), ROPT(4) .. ROPT(7), resp.  See the CVODE manual for details. 
 * IER    = return completion flag.  Values are 0 = success, and -1 = failure.
 *          See printed message for details in case of failure.
 * 
 * (4.3) To allocate memory and initialize data associated with the CVBBDPRE
 * preconditioner, make the following call:
 *       CALL FCVBBDINIT(NLOCAL, MUDQ, MLDQ, MU, ML, DQRELY, IER)
 * 
 * The arguments are:
 * NLOCAL    = local size of vectors on this processor
 * MUDQ,MLDQ = upper and lower half-bandwidths to be used in the computation
 *             of the local Jacobian blocks by difference quotients.
 *             These may be smaller than the true half-bandwidths of the
 *             Jacobian of the local block of g, when smaller values may
 *             provide greater efficiency.
 * MU, ML    = upper and lower half-bandwidths of the band matrix that 
 *             is retained as an approximation of the local Jacobian block.
 *             These may be smaller than MUDQ and MLDQ.
 * DQRELY    = relative increment factor in y for difference quotients
 *             (optional). 0.0 indicates the default, sqrt(unit roundoff).
 * IER       = return completion flag: IER=0: success, IER<0: an error occured
 * 
 * (4.4) To specify the SPGMR linear system solver and use it with the CVBBDPRE
 * preconditioner, make the following call:
 *       CALL FCVBBDSPGMR(IPRETYPE, IGSTYPE, MAXL, DELT, IER)
 *
 * the arguments are:
 * IPRETYPE  = preconditioner type: 
 *             0 = none
 *             1 = left only
 *             2 = right only
 *             3 = both sides.
 * IGSTYPE   = Gram-schmidt process type: 1 = modified G-S, 1 = classical G-S.
 * MAXL      = maximum Krylov subspace dimension; 0 indicates default.
 * DELT      = linear convergence tolerance factor; 0.0 indicates default.
 * IER       = return completion flag: IER=0: success, IER<0: an error occured
 *
 * (4.5) To specify whether GMRES should use the supplied FCVJTIMES or the 
 * internal finite difference approximation, make the call
 *        CALL FCVSPGMRSETJAC(FLAG, IER)
 * where FLAG=0 for finite differences approxaimtion or
 *       FLAG=1 to use the supplied routine FCVJTIMES
 * 
 * (5) Re-initialization: FCVREINIT, FCVBBDREINIT
 * If a sequence of problems of the same size is being solved using the SPGMR
 * linear solver in combination with the CVBBDPRE preconditioner, then the
 * CVODE package can be re-initialized for the second and subsequent problems
 * so as to avoid further memory allocation.  First, in place of the call
 * to FCVMALLOC, make the following call:
 *       CALL FCVREINIT(T0, Y0, METH, ITMETH, IATOL, RTOL, ATOL, INOPT,
 *      1               IOPT, ROPT, IER)
 * The arguments have the same names and meanings as those of FCVMALLOC,
 * except that NEQ has been omitted from the argument list (being unchanged
 * for the new problem).  FCVREINIT performs the same initializations as
 * FCVMALLOC, but does no memory allocation, using instead the existing
 * internal memory created by the previous FCVMALLOC call.
 * Following the call to FCVREINIT, a call to FCVBBDINIT may or may not be needed.
 * If the input arguments are the same, no FCVBBDINIT call is needed.
 * If there is a change in input arguments other than MU, ML or MAXL, then 
 * the user program should call FCVBBDREINIT.  This reinitializes the SPGMR
 * linear solver, but without reallocating its memory.  The arguments of the
 * FCVBBDREINIT routine have the same names and meanings as FCVBBDINIT.  
 * Finally, if the value of MU, ML, or MAXL is being changed, then a call to 
 * FCVBBDINIT must be made; in this case the SPGMR memory is reallocated.
 * 
 * (6) The integrator: FCVODE
 * Carrying out the integration is accomplished by making calls as follows:
 *       CALL FCVODE (TOUT, T, Y, ITASK, IER)
 * The arguments are:
 * TOUT  = next value of t at which a solution is desired (input)
 * T     = value of t reached by the solver on output
 * Y     = array containing the computed solution on output
 * ITASK = task indicator: 
 *         1 = normal mode (overshoot TOUT and interpolate)
 *         2 = one-step mode (return after each internal step taken)
 *         3 = normal mode with TSTOP check
 *         4 = one-step mode with TSTOP check
 * IER   = completion flag: 0 = success, values -1 ... -8 are various
 *         failure modes (see CVODE User Guide).
 * The current values of the optional outputs are available in IOPT and ROPT.
 * 
 * (7) Optional outputs: FCVBBDOPT
 * Optional outputs specific to the SPGMR solver are NPE, NLI, NPS, NCFL,
 * LRW, and LIW, stored in IOPT(16) ... IOPT(21), respectively.
 * To obtain the optional outputs associated with the CVBBDPRE module, make
 * the following call:
 *       CALL FCVBBDOPT (LENRPW, LENIPW, NGE)
 * The arguments returned are:
 * LENRPW = length of real preconditioner work space, in realtype words.
 *          This size is local to the current processor.
 * LENIPW = length of integer preconditioner work space, in integer words.
 *          This size is local to the current processor.
 * NGE    = number of g(t,y) evaluations (calls to CVLOCFN) so far.
 * 
 * (8) Computing solution derivatives: FCVDKY
 * To obtain a derivative of the solution (optionally), of order up to
 * the current method order, make the following call:
 *       CALL FCVDKY (T, K, DKY)
 * The arguments are:
 * T   = value of t at which solution derivative is desired
 * K   = derivative order (0 .le. K .le. QU)
 * DKY = array containing computed K-th derivative of y on return
 * 
 * (9) Memory freeing: FCVBBDFREE, FCVFREE, and FNVFREEP
 *   To the free the internal memory created by the calls to FNVINITP,
 * FCVMALLOC, and FCVBBDINIT, make the following calls, in this order:
 *       CALL FCVBBDFREE
 *       CALL FCVFREE
 *       CALL FNVFREEP
