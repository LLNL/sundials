<!-- Thank you for your interest in contributing to SUNDIALS. A pull request to SUNDIALS requires the following steps to be completed -->

- [ ] Please target the `develop` branch not `main`.
- [ ] Review our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md), and ensure that you sign your last commit (at minimum) as per the guide.
- [ ] Provide a concise description of what your pull request does, and why it is needed/benefical.
- [ ] Add a note about your change to the `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/shared/RecentChanges.rst`. Notice that the former is a markdown file and the latter is reStructuredText, so the formatting is slightly different.
- [ ] After your PR is opened, ensure that all of the tests are passing (a SUNDIALS developer will have to allow the testing to run).
