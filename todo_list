To Do List for SUNDIALS, as of 11/16/12

Develop a set of unit tests for the vector kernel operations.  This 
set of tests should be something a user could employ to verify 
their own vector kernel is correct.  (Of course, ours should pass these
tests!)

Make build system handling of examples consistent.  Right now, distclean
does not remove compiled examples.  Also, the install builds an examples
directory, but the executables are not copied there.

Verify output of examples used in new testing system are indeed correct.
As part of this we probably should tighten absolute tolerances on Krylov
example codes as there is a good bit of variation on consecutive parallel runs
and even between systems.  Maybe try abstol = 10^-6?

Provide better guidance as to exactly what the from of the Jacobian is
for use adding a new linear solver.  Math considerations in IDA indicates
teh Jacobian is dF/dy + alpha dF/dydot.  But, alpha is not defined and
cj is teh variable in the IDA structures that the user needs for this.
CVODE likely also has similar disconect but I did nto check this.

(LEB, 7/30/13)
When running tests (i.e. testRunner) the 'output' directory is build
within the source tree - don't want anything in source tree.  The output
should be built in the 'Testing' directory relative to the directory in
which 'make test' is run.
