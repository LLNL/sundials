# SUNDIALS: SUite of Nonlinear and DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers #
### Version 7.2.1 (Dec 2024) ###

**Center for Applied Scientific Computing, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory**

SUNDIALS is a family of software packages providing robust and efficient time
integrators and nonlinear solvers that can easily be incorporated into existing
simulation codes. The packages are designed to require minimal information from
the user, allow users to supply their own data structures underneath the
packages, and enable interfacing with user-supplied or third-party algebraic
solvers and preconditioners.

The SUNDIALS suite consists of the following packages for ordinary differential
equation (ODE) systems, differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems, and
nonlinear algebraic systems:

* ARKODE - for integrating stiff, nonstiff, and multirate ODEs of the form

  $$M(t) \\, y' = f_1(t,y) + f_2(t,y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0$$

* CVODE - for integrating stiff and nonstiff ODEs of the form

  $$y' = f(t,y), \quad y(t_0) = y_0$$

* CVODES - for integrating and sensitivity analysis (forward and adjoint) of
  ODEs of the form

  $$y' = f(t,y,p), \quad y(t_0) = y_0(p)$$

* IDA - for integrating DAEs of the form

  $$F(t,y,y') = 0, \quad y(t_0) = y_0, \quad y'(t_0) = y_0'$$

* IDAS - for integrating and sensitivity analysis (forward and adjoint) of DAEs
  of the form

  $$F(t,y,y',p) = 0, \quad y(t_0) = y_0(p), \quad y'(t_0) = y_0'(p)$$

* KINSOL - for solving nonlinear algebraic systems of the form

  $$F(u) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad G(u) = u$$

## Installation ##

For installation directions, see the [getting started](https://sundials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sundials/index.html#getting-started)
section in the online documentation. In the [released tarballs](https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/releases),
installation directions are also available in `INSTALL_GUIDE.pdf` and the
installation chapter of the user guides in the `doc` directory.

Warning to users who receive more than one of the individual packages at
different times: Mixing old and new versions of SUNDIALS may fail. To avoid such
failures, obtain all desired package at the same time.

## Support ##

Full user guides for all of the SUNDIALS packages are available [online](https://sundials.readthedocs.io).
In the [released tarballs](https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/releases), the `doc`
directory includes PDFs of the user guides and documentation for the example
programs. The example program documentation PDFs are also available on the
[releases page](https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/releases).

For information on recent changes to SUNDIALS see the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)
or the introduction chapter of any package user guide.

A list of Frequently Asked Questions on build and installation procedures as
well as common usage issues is available on the SUNDIALS
[FAQ](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/faq). For dealing with
systems with nonphysical solutions or discontinuities see the SUNDIALS
[usage notes](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/usage-notes).

If you have a question not covered in the FAQ or usage notes, please submit your
question as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/issues) or to the
SUNDIALS [mailing list](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/mailing-list).
