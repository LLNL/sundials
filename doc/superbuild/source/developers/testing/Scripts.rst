CI Testing Scripts
==================

Some of the CI suites utilize various scripts in the ``test`` directory to setup
and run tests.

Test Driver
-----------

The script ``test_driver.sh`` is used to drive tests in the Jenkins and
GitHub CI. The input option ``--testtype`` can be used to select from a
predefined set of test configurations:

* BRANCH -- C99 build tests and a small set of build and run tests.

* PR -- C99 build tests and a larger set of build, run, and install tests using
  the SUNDIALS release tarball.

* RELEASE -- C99 build tests and an even larger set of build, run, and install
  tests using the SUNDIALS release tarball.

* CUSTOM -- run a single user-defined test configuration set using additional
  input options.

Run ``test_driver.sh -h`` for more information on the options available.

Testing Environment
-------------------

The environment setup script, ``env/setup_env.sh``, and a machine-specific
script are used by the test driver to configure the testing environment. The
machine script can be specified using the ``--env`` option to ``test_driver.sh``
otherwise, the following variables/locations will be checked:

#. The script specified by the environment variable ``SUNDIALS_ENV_FILE``
#. A user's local environment script: ``<sunrepo>/test/env/env.sh``

The setup script will set various environment variables based on inputs from the
test driver to configure SUNDIALS. Any unrecognized input options passed to the
test driver will be passed through to the machine script to supply additional
setup information. For example, a compiler spec could be passed through to the
machine script to change the compiler used when testing.

The setup script will set the following environment variables (among others):

* ``SUNDIALS_PRECISION`` the real type: ``single``, ``double``, or ``extended``

* ``SUNDIALS_INDEX_SIZE`` the index size: ``32`` or ``64``

* ``SUNDIALS_LIBRARY_TYPE`` the library type: ``shared``, ``static`` or ``both``

* ``SUNDIALS_TPLS`` enable third-party libraries (TPLs): ``ON`` or ``OFF``

* ``SUNDIALS_TEST_TYPE`` enable additional tests: ``STD`` or ``DEV``

  - When set to ``DEV``, development and unit tests will be enabled

After this initial setup, the machine script is called to set any additional
environment variables need to configure SUNDIALS for testing. Currently, these
include the following:

Test Runner
-----------

When comparing test outputs with answer files or profiling tests with Caliper
the Python test runner, ``test/testRunner``, is used run the test under CTest.
