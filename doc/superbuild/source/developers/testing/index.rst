Testing
=======

We include several types of tests in SUNDIALS: unit tests, integration test and performance tests.
These tests are run via as part of our :ref:`Continuous Integration suite <CI>`.
 
**Unit Tests**

The unit tests reside in two places: ``test/unit_tests`` and in files named ``test_`` within
``examples/``. With few exceptions, SUNDIALS unit tests should return an exit code indicating if the
test was successful or not. I.e., they should be self-contained and not require any output file to
determine success or failure.

**Integration Tests**

The integration tests are dual purpose; they serve as tests and also examples for users. They are
found in ``examples/``. The integration tests produce output that is checked against an output file,
i.e. an answer file, to determine if the test passed or failed. See :ref:`Answers <Answers>` for details.

**Performance Tests**

These tests are benchmarks of SUNDIALS performance and are found in ``benchmarks/``. Refer to
:ref:`Continuous Performance Testing <CPT>` for more detail.
