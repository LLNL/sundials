Useful Utilities
================

This section mentions some useful utilities and internal data structures that you may
need or come across in SUNDIALS. We do not document these fully here, instead, look
for comments in the source. 

Data Structures
---------------

We have our own implementation of a hash map, ``SUNHashMap``. It is found at
``src/sundials/sundials_hashmap_impl.h`` and ``src/sundials/sundials_hashmap.c``.

We have a C implementation of a ``std::vector`` in ``src/sundials/stl``. 

We have an implementation of a hierarchical node object, which can be used to
build things like a JSON tree, at ``src/sundials/sundials_datanode.{h,c}``.
