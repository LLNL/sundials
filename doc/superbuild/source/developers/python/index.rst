Python Interfaces
=================

This chapter covers details developers need to know about the SUNDIALS Python interfaces.


nanobind
--------

We use `nanobind <https://github.com/wjakob/nanobind>__` for the Python bindings. nanobind is a sleeker, faster ``pybind11``.
It is a C++ library, i.e. you write your binding code in C++. Nanobind does have some restrictions:

- Cannot bind to functions which take double, or more pointer arguments. I.e., it cannot bind to `**` or `***` and so on.
- Cannot implicitly convert between a "View" container class and the underlying C type. I.e., it cannot implicitly convert ``NVectorView`` to ``N_Vector``.
   This means user must explicitly convert from the "View" class by calling the ``get`` member function. 


Litgen
------

We use `litgen <https://github.com/pthom/litgen>__` to generate a large portion of the nanobind code.

- We have ``generate.yaml`` files designate headers to generate bindings from and functions to exclude.
- A ``generate.py`` script uses litgen to generate the bindings as a C++ header according to the ``generate.yaml``.
- For each generated file, there is a hand-coded file that includes the generated header.  

.. note::

    Litgen itself is licensed under GPLv3. This means the ``generate.py`` script is effectively governed by ``GPLv3``,  
    **but the binding code generated by the script/litgen falls only under our SUNDIALS license**. 
    Because of this, the ``generate.py`` script is in a separate git repository.
