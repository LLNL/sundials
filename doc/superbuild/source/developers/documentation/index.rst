Documentation
=============

The SUNDIALS user guides are written using reStructuredText and `Sphinx
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__. The generated HTML documentation is available
on `Read the Docs <https://sundials.readthedocs.io>`__ and PDF versions are
included in the release tarballs. The documentation for example programs is
currently written in LaTeX for all packages expect for ARKODE. The LaTeX
example documentation will also be converted to reStructuredtext in the future.

This chapter covers how to setup Sphinx, build the SUNDIALS documentation, and
the documentation style conventions.
