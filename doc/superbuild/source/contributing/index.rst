Contributing
============

There are two primary ways of contributing to SUNDIALS. The first way is by particpating
in the development of SUNDIALS directly through contributions of code to the primary
`SUNDIALS repository <https://github.com/LLNL/sundials>`_. This is the best way to contribute
bug fixes and minor improvements.  At this time, the SUNDIALS team does not have the resources
to review and take in large additions to the code or significant new features.
Larger additions can be contributed as a SUNDIALS "addon" which is a component that may be
optionally downloaded by users and then compiled and installed with SUNDIALS.

.. note::

   New SUNDIALS developers should read the :ref:`Developer` guide for information on
   how to participate in SUNDIALS development.


Direct Contributions via Pull Requests
--------------------------------------

Direct contributions to SUNDIALS are made by opening a :ref:`Pull Request <OpenPR>`.

All new contributions to SUNDIALS must be made under the BSD 3-clause license.
The SUNDIALS team will not accept any file previously released under any other open
source license. By submitting code, the contributor gives irreversible consent
to the redistribution and/or modification of the contributed source code.

Please ensure that any pull request includes user guide additions or changes as
appropriate, has been tested, and includes a test for any added features.

Any added files submitted with a pull request must contain a header section at
the top including the originating author's name and file origin date as well as
a pointer to the SUNDIALS LICENSE and NOTICE files.

The act of submitting a pull request (with or without an explicit Signed-off-by
tag) will be understood as an affirmation of the following `Developer's
Certificate of Origin (DCO) <http://developercertificate.org/>`_.

By including the DCO signature, you are stating that one or
more of the following is true of your contribution:

1.  You created this contribution/change and have the right to submit it

   Signed-off-by: Jane Doe <jdoe@address.com>


Replacing Jane Doeâ€™s details with your name and email address.

If you've set ``user.name`` and ``user.email`` in your Git configuration, you can
automatically add a sign off line at the end of the commit message by using the
``-s`` option (e.g., ``git commit -s``).


Contributions via SUNDIALS Addons
---------------------------------

SUNDIALS "addons" are community developed code additions for SUNDIALS that can be subsumed by the
SUNDIALS build system so that they have full access to all internal SUNDIALS symbols.
The intent is for SUNDIALS addons to function as if they are part of the SUNDIALS library,
while allowing them to potentially have different licenses
(although we encourage BSD-3-Clause still), code style
(although we encourage them to follow the SUNDIALS style outlined :ref:`here <Style>`),
and they **are not maintained by the SUNDIALS team**.

Creating an addon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create a SUNDIALS addon and use it there are a few things you need to do:

1. In your addon project, ensure that you have a ``CMakeLists.txt`` that uses the
   ``sundials_add_library`` CMake macro to create the library target. The best thing to do is simply
   copy from, or refer to, a ``CMakeLists.txt`` in the SUNDIALS ``src`` directory.
2. Follow the steps in the ``README.md`` file in the ``external/`` directory in the root of the SUNDIALS
   source code.

An example addon is available `here <https://github.com/sundials-codes/sundials-addon-example>`_.

Friends of SUNDIALS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SUNDIALS team maintains a list of some SUNDIALS addons in our `Friends of SUNDIALS
<https://github.com/sundials-codes/friends-of-sundials>`_ repository. These addons are not
maintained by the SUNDIALS team, but have been developed in consultation with us.
**Currently we are only adding projects for existing collaborations**.
Please contact the development team if you are interested in collaborating on an addon.
