SUNDIALS
########

The `SUNDIALS <https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials>`_ library of time
integrators and nonlinear solvers provides robust and efficient numerical
methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), differential-algebraic
equations (DAEs), and nonlinear algebraic systems. SUNDIALS is freely available
and developed on `GitHub <https://github.com/LLNL/sundials>`_.

SUNDIALS is comprised of following packages:

* :ref:`ARKODE <ARKODE>`, a solver with one-step methods for stiff, nonstiff,
  mixed stiff-nonstiff, and multirate ODE systems.

* :ref:`CVODE <CVODE>`, a solver with Adams and BDF methods for stiff and
  nonstiff ODE systems.

* :ref:`CVODES <CVODES>`, an extension of CVODE with forward and adjoint
  sensitivity analysis capabilities for stiff and nonstiff ODE systems.

* :ref:`IDA <IDA>`, a solver with BDF methods for DAE systems.

* :ref:`IDAS <IDAS>`, an extension of IDA with forward and adjoint sensitivity
  analysis capabilities for DAE systems.

* :ref:`KINSOL <KINSOL>`, a solver for nonlinear algebraic systems.

The SUNDIALS packages share many components and are organized as a family built
on a common infrastructure including abstract interfaces for vectors, matrices,
and algebraic solvers. Several implementations of these interfaces are provided
with SUNDIALS supporting a range of parallel computing paradigms including
shared-memory, distributed memory, and GPU computing.
