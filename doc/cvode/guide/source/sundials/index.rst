As discussed in :numref:`CVODE.Organization`, the six solvers packages
(CVODE(S), IDA(S), ARKODE, KINSOL) that make up SUNDIALS are built upon common
classes/modules for vectors, matrices, and algebraic solvers. In addition, the
six packages all leverage some other common infrastructure, which we discuss
in this section.
