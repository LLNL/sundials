Parallel HYPRE C example problems -- Deep dive
==================================================



.. _deep_dive.cvAdvDiff_non_ph:

A nonstiff example: cvAdvDiff_non_ph [DD]
======================================================

This example is same as :literal:`cvAdvDiff_non_p`, except that it
uses the **HYPRE** vector type instead of the **SUNDIALS** native
*parallel vector* implementation.

The outputs from the two examples are identical. In the following, we will point 
out only the differences between the two. Familiarity with `HYPRE <https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre>`_
library at `HYPRE User Manual <https://hypre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is helpful.  

We use the **HYPRE IJ** *vector interface* to allocate the template vector and 
create parallel partitioning: ::

   HYPRE_IJVectorCreate(comm, my_base, my_base + local_N - 1, &Uij);
   HYPRE_IJVectorSetObjectType(Uij, HYPRE_PARCSR);
   HYPRE_IJVectorInitialize(Uij);

The initialize call means that vector elements are ready to be set using 
the **IJ** *interface*. We choose an *initial condition vector* :math:`x_0 = x(t_0)` as the 
*template vector* and we set its values in the :code:`SetIC(...)` function. We 
complete the **HYPRE vector** *assembly* by: :: 

   HYPRE_IJVectorAssemble(Uij);
   HYPRE_IJVectorGetObject(Uij, (void**) &Upar);

The *assemble call* is collective and it makes **HYPRE vector** ready to use. 
This sets the handle :code:`Upar` to the actual **HYPRE vector**. 
The handle is then passed to the :code:`N_VMake` function, which creates 
the template :code:`N_Vector` as a *wrapper* around the **HYPRE vector**. 
All other vectors in the computation are created by cloning the template 
vector. The template vector does not own the underlying **HYPRE vector**, 
and it is the user's responsibility to destroy it using a
:code:`HYPRE_IJVectorDestroy(Uij)` call after the template vector has been 
destroyed. This function will destroy both the **HYPRE vector** and its **IJ**
*interface*.

To access individual elements of solution vectors :math:`u =` ``u`` and :math:`\dot u =` ``udot`` 
in the *residual function*, the user needs to extract the **HYPRE vector** first 
by calling :code:`N_VGetVector_ParHyp`, and then use **HYPRE methods** from 
that point on.

.. warning::

   At this point interfaces to **HYPRE** *solvers* and *preconditioners* are 
   not available. They will be provided in subsequent **SUNDIALS** releases. 
   The *interface* to **HYPRE vector** is included in this release mainly for 
   testing purposes and as a preview of functionality to come.
