The Sphinx-based documentation in ARKode is grouped into three
subdirectories:

1. extra_packages: this folder contains Python modules that can be
   installed (via "pip") to set up your environment to compile the
   documentation.  Unfortunately, the "sphinx-fortran" extension (that
   we use to handle the naming, arguments and indexing of Fortran
   interfaces) has not been updated in some time, so we currently must
   use an older version of Sphinx (1.6.7) than what is available in
   many package-management systems.

   To install the two Python packages (Sphinx v1.6.7 and
   sphinx-fortran), as well as the "bootstrap" theme used in the HTML
   version of the ARKode documentation, just run
   "sudo ./install_extensions.sh" at the linux/OSX command prompt.

2. guide: this folder contains the Re-Structured text and Python
   configuration files for the main ARKode user guide.

3. examples: this folder contains the Re-Structured text and Python
   configuration files for the ARKode example guide.

Additional documentation on compiling the user guide and example guide
is contained in the README files of the 'guide' and 'examples'
folders, respectively.
