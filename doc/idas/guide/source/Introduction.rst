Introduction
************

IDAS is part of a software family called SUNDIALS: SUite of Nonlinear and
DIfferential/ALgebraic equation Solvers :cite:p:`HBGLSSW:05`.  This suite
consists of CVODE, ARKODE, KINSOL, and IDAS, and variants of these with
sensitivity analysis capabilities, CVODES and IDAS.

IDAS is a general purpose solver for the initial value problem (IVP) for systems
of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). The name IDAS stands for Implicit
Differential-Algebraic solver with Sensitivity capabilities. IDAS is an
extension of the IDA solver within SUNDIALS, itself based on on DASPK
:cite:p:`BHP:94,BHP:98`, but is written in ANSI-standard C rather than
Fortran77.  Its most notable features are that, (1) in the solution of the
underlying nonlinear system at each time step, it offers a choice of
Newton/direct methods and a choice of Inexact Newton/Krylov (iterative) methods;
and (2) it is written in a *data-independent* manner in that it acts on generic
vectors and matrices without any assumptions on the underlying organization of
the data.  Thus IDAS shares significant modules previously written within CASC
at LLNL to support the ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers CVODE
:cite:p:`cvode_ug,CoHi:96` and PVODE :cite:p:`ByHi:98,ByHi:99`, and also the
nonlinear system solver KINSOL :cite:p:`kinsol_ug`.

At present, IDAS may utilize a variety of Krylov methods provided in SUNDIALS
that can be used in conjunction with Newton iteration: these include the GMRES
(Generalized Minimal RESidual) :cite:p:`SaSc:86`, FGMRES (Flexible Generalized
Minimum RESidual) :cite:p:`Saa:93`, Bi-CGStab (Bi-Conjugate Gradient Stabilized)
:cite:p:`Van:92`, TFQMR (Transpose-Free Quasi-Minimal Residual)
:cite:p:`Fre:93`, and PCG (Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient) :cite:p:`HeSt:52`
linear iterative methods. As Krylov methods, these require little matrix storage
for solving the Newton equations as compared to direct methods. However, the
algorithms allow for a user-supplied preconditioner, and, for most
problems, preconditioning is essential for an efficient solution.

For very large DAE systems, the Krylov methods are preferable over direct linear
solver methods, and are often the only feasible choice.  Among the Krylov
methods in SUNDIALS, we recommend GMRES as the best overall choice. However,
users are encouraged to compare all options, especially if encountering
convergence failures with GMRES.  Bi-CGFStab and TFQMR have an advantage in
storage requirements, in that the number of workspace vectors they require is
fixed, while that number for GMRES depends on the desired Krylov subspace
size. FGMRES has an advantage in that it is designed to support preconditioners
that vary between iterations (e.g. iterative methods). PCG exhibits rapid
convergence and minimal workspace vectors, but only works for symmetric linear
systems.

IDAS is written with a functionality that is a superset of that of IDA.
Sensitivity analysis capabilities, both forward and adjoint, have been added to
the main integrator. Enabling forward sensitivity computations in IDAS will
result in the code integrating the so-called *sensitivity equations*
simultaneously with the original IVP, yielding both the solution and its
sensitivity with respect to parameters in the model. Adjoint sensitivity
analysis, most useful when the gradients of relatively few functionals of the
solution with respect to many parameters are sought, involves integration of the
original IVP forward in time followed by the integration of the so-called
*adjoint equations* backward in time. IDAS provides the infrastructure needed to
integrate any final-condition ODE dependent on the solution of the original IVP
(in particular the adjoint system).


..
   There are several motivations for choosing the C language for IDAS.  First, a
   general movement away from Fortran and toward C in scientific computing was
   apparent. Second, the pointer, structure, and dynamic memory allocation features
   in C are extremely useful in software of this complexity, with the great variety
   of method options offered.  Finally, we prefer C over C++ for IDAS because of the
   wider availability of C compilers, the potentially greater efficiency of C, and
   the greater ease of interfacing the solver to applications written in extended
   Fortran.

.. _IDAS.Introduction.Reading:

Reading this User Guide
=======================

The structure of this document is as follows:

* In Chapter :numref:`IDAS.Mathematics`, we give short descriptions of the numerical
  methods implemented by IDAS for the solution of initial value problems for
  systems of DAEs, along with short descriptions of preconditioning
  (:numref:`IDAS.Mathematics.Preconditioning`) and rootfinding
  (:numref:`IDAS.Mathematics.rootfinding`).

* The following chapter describes the software organization of the IDAS
  solver (:numref:`IDAS.Organization`).

* Chapter :numref:`IDAS.Usage.SIM` is the main usage document for IDAS
  for simulation applications. It includes a complete description of the user
  interface for the integration of DAE initial value problems. Readers that are
  not interested in using IDAS for sensitivity analysis can then skip the next
  two chapters.

* Chapter :numref:`IDAS.Usage.FSA` describes the usage of IDAS for forward
  sensitivity analysis as an extension of its IVP integration capabilities. We
  begin with a skeleton of the user main program, with emphasis on the steps
  that are required in addition to those already described in Chapter
  :numref:`IDAS.Usage.SIM`. Following that we provide detailed
  descriptions of the user-callable interface routines specific to forward
  sensitivity analysis and of the additional optional user-defined routines.

* Chapter :numref:`IDAS.Usage.ADJ` describes the usage of IDAS for adjoint
  sensitivity analysis. We begin by describing the IDAS checkpointing
  implementation for interpolation of the original IVP solution during
  integration of the adjoint system backward in time, and with an overview of a
  user's main program. Following that we provide complete descriptions of the
  user-callable interface routines for adjoint sensitivity analysis as well as
  descriptions of the required additional user-defined routines.

* Chapter :numref:`NVectors` gives a brief overview of the generic ``N_Vector``
  module shared among the various components of SUNDIALS, as well as details on
  the ``N_Vector`` implementations provided with SUNDIALS.

* Chapter :numref:`SUNMatrix` gives a brief overview of the generic
  ``SUNMatrix`` module shared among the various components of SUNDIALS, and
  details on the ``SUNMatrix`` implementations provided with SUNDIALS.

* Chapter :numref:`SUNLinSol` gives a brief overview of the generic
  ``SUNLinearSolver`` module shared among the various components of
  SUNDIALS. This chapter contains details on the ``SUNLinearSolver``
  implementations provided with SUNDIALS.  The chapter also contains details on
  the ``SUNLinearSolver`` implementations provided with SUNDIALS that interface
  with external linear solver libraries.

* Chapter :numref:`SUNNonlinSol` describes the ``SUNNonlinearSolver`` API and
  nonlinear solver implementations shared among the various components of
  SUNDIALS.

* Finally, in the appendices, we provide detailed instructions for the
  installation of IDAS, within the structure of SUNDIALS (Appendix
  :numref:`Installation`), as well as a list of all the constants used for input
  to and output from IDAS functions (Appendix :numref:`IDAS.Constants`).

..
   Finally, the reader should be aware of the following notational conventions in
   this user guide: program listings and identifiers (such as :c:func:`IDAInit`)
   within textual explanations appear in typewriter type style; fields in C
   structures (such as *content*) appear in italics; and packages or modules, such
   as IDADLS, are written in all capitals.
