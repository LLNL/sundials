\chapter{Using IDAS for IVP Solution}\label{s:simulation}
%%===================================================================================

This chapter is concerned with the use of {\idas} for the integration
of DAEs in a C language setting.  The following sections treat the header files,
the layout of the user's main program, description of the {\idas} user-callable
functions, and description of user-supplied functions.
This usage is essentially equivalent to using {\ida}~\cite{ida_ug}.

The sample programs described in the companion document \cite{idas_ex}
may also be helpful. Those codes may be used as templates (with the removal of
some lines involved in testing), and are included in the {\idas} package.

The user should be aware that not all {\sunlinsol} and {\sunmatrix}
modules are compatible with all {\nvector} implementations.
\index{IDAS@{\idas} linear solvers!NVECTOR@{\nvector} compatibility}
Details on compatibility are given in the documentation for each
{\sunmatrix} module (Chapter \ref{s:sunmatrix}) and each {\sunlinsol}
module (Chapter \ref{s:sunlinsol}). For example, {\nvecp} is not
compatible with the dense, banded, or sparse {\sunmatrix} types, or with
the corresponding dense, banded, or sparse {\sunlinsol} modules.  Please
check Chapters \ref{s:sunmatrix} and \ref{s:sunlinsol} to verify
compatibility between these modules.  In addition to that
documentation, we note that the preconditioner module {\idabbdpre}
can only be used with {\nvecp}.
It is not recommended to use a threaded vector module with SuperLU\_MT
unless it is the {\nvecopenmp} module, and SuperLU\_MT is also compiled
with OpenMP.

{\idas} uses various constants for both input and output.  These are
defined as needed in this chapter, but for convenience are also listed
separately in Appendix \ref{c:constants}.

%%==============================================================================
\section{Access to library and header files}\label{ss:file_access}
%%==============================================================================

At this point, it is assumed that the installation of {\idas},
following the procedure described in Appendix \ref{c:install}, has
been completed successfully.

Regardless of where the user's application program resides, its
associated compilation and load commands must make reference to the
appropriate locations for the library and header files required by
{\idas}.  The relevant library files are
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em libdir}\id{/libsundials\_idas.}{\em lib},
\item {\em libdir}\id{/libsundials\_nvec*.}{\em lib},
\end{itemize}
where the file extension .{\em lib} is typically \id{.so} for shared libraries
and \id{.a} for static libraries. The relevant header files are located in
the subdirectories
\begin{itemize}
\item {\em incdir}\id{/include/idas}
\item {\em incdir}\id{/include/sundials}
\item {\em incdir}\id{/include/nvector}
\item {\em incdir}\id{/include/sunmatrix}
\item {\em incdir}\id{/include/sunlinsol}
\item {\em incdir}\id{/include/sunnonlinsol}
\end{itemize}
The directories {\em libdir} and {\em incdir} are the install library
and include directories, respectively. For a default installation,
these are {\em instdir}\id{/lib} and {\em instdir}\id{/include},
respectively, where {\em instdir} is the directory where {\sundials}
was installed (see Appendix \ref{c:install}).

Note that an application cannot link to both the {\ida} and {\idas} libraries
because both contain user-callable functions with the same names (to ensure that {\idas}
is backward compatible with {\ida}). Therefore, applications that contain both
DAE problems and DAEs with sensitivity analysis, should use {\idas}.

%%===================================================================================
\input{types}

%%===================================================================================
\section{Header files}\label{ss:header_sim}
%%===================================================================================
\index{header files}
The calling program must include several header files so that various macros
and data types can be used. The header file that is always required is:
%%
\begin{itemize}
\item  \Id{idas/idas.h},
  the header file for {\idas}, which defines the several
  types and various constants, and includes function prototypes.  This
  includes the header file for {\idals}, \Id{ida/ida\_ls.h}.
\end{itemize}
%%
Note that \id{idas.h} includes \Id{sundials\_types.h},
which defines the types \id{realtype}, \id{sunindextype}, and \id{booleantype}
and the constants \id{SUNFALSE} and \id{SUNTRUE}.

The calling program must also include an {\nvector} implementation header file,
of the form \\ \noindent
\id{nvector/nvector\_***.h}.  See Chapter \ref{s:nvector} for the appropriate
name.  This file in turn includes the header file \Id{sundials\_nvector.h}
which defines the abstract \Id{N\_Vector} data type.

If using a non-default nonlinear solver module, or when interacting
with a {\sunnonlinsol} module directly, the calling program must also
include a {\sunnonlinsol} implementation header file, of the form
\id{sunnonlinsol/sunnonlinsol\_***.h} where \id{***} is the name of the
nonlinear solver module (see Chapter \ref{c:sunnonlinsol} for more
information). This file in turn includes the header file
\Id{sundials\_nonlinearsolver.h} which defines the abstract
\Id{SUNNonlinearSolver} data type.

If using a nonlinear solver that requires the solution of a linear
system of the form (\ref{e:DAE_Newtoncorr}) (e.g., the default Newton
iteration), a linear solver module header file is also required.
\index{IDAS@{\idas} linear solvers!header files}
The header files corresponding to the various {\sundials}-provided
linear solver modules available for use with {\idas} are: 
%%
\begin{itemize}
\item Direct linear solvers:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \Id{sunlinsol/sunlinsol\_dense.h},
    which is used with the dense linear solver module,
    {\sunlinsoldense};

  \item \Id{sunlinsol/sunlinsol\_band.h},
    which is used with the banded linear solver module,
    {\sunlinsolband};

  \item \Id{sunlinsol/sunlinsol\_lapackdense.h},
    which is used with the LAPACK dense linear solver module,
    {\sunlinsollapdense};

  \item \Id{sunlinsol/sunlinsol\_lapackband.h},
    which is used with the LAPACK banded linear solver module,
    {\sunlinsollapband};

  \item \Id{sunlinsol/sunlinsol\_klu.h},
    which is used with the {\klu} sparse linear solver module,
    {\sunlinsolklu};

  \item \Id{sunlinsol/sunlinsol\_superlumt.h},
    which is used with the {\superlumt} sparse linear solver
    module, {\sunlinsolslumt};
  \end{itemize}

\item Iterative linear solvers:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \Id{sunlinsol/sunlinsol\_spgmr.h},
    which is used with the scaled, preconditioned GMRES Krylov linear
    solver module, {\sunlinsolspgmr};

  \item \Id{sunlinsol/sunlinsol\_spfgmr.h},
    which is used with the scaled, preconditioned FGMRES Krylov linear
    solver module, {\sunlinsolspfgmr};

  \item \Id{sunlinsol/sunlinsol\_spbcgs.h},
    which is used with the scaled, preconditioned Bi-CGStab Krylov
    linear solver module, {\sunlinsolspbcgs};

  \item \Id{sunlinsol/sunlinsol\_sptfqmr.h},
    which is used with the scaled, preconditioned TFQMR Krylov linear
    solver module, {\sunlinsolsptfqmr};

  \item \Id{sunlinsol/sunlinsol\_pcg.h},
    which is used with the scaled, preconditioned CG Krylov linear
    solver module, {\sunlinsolpcg};
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The header files for the {\sunlinsoldense} and {\sunlinsollapdense}
linear solver modules include the file
\id{sunmatrix/sunmatrix\_dense.h}, which defines the {\sunmatdense}
matrix module, as as well as various functions and macros acting on
such matrices.

The header files for the {\sunlinsolband} and {\sunlinsollapband}
linear solver modules include the file
\id{sunmatrix/sunmatrix\_band.h}, which defines the {\sunmatband}
matrix module, as as well as various functions and macros acting on
such matrices.

The header files for the {\sunlinsolklu} and {\sunlinsolslumt}
sparse linear solvers include the file
\id{sunmatrix/sunmatrix\_sparse.h}, which defines the {\sunmatsparse}
matrix module, as well as various functions and macros acting on such
matrices.

The header files for the Krylov iterative solvers include the file
\id{sundials/sundials\_iterative.h}, which enumerates the kind of
preconditioning, and (for the {\spgmr} and {\spfgmr} solvers) the
choices for the Gram-Schmidt process.

Other headers may be needed, according to the choice of
preconditioner, etc.  For example, in the \id{idasFoodWeb\_kry\_p}
example (see \cite{idas_ex}), preconditioning is done with a
block-diagonal matrix. For this, even though the {\sunlinsolspgmr}
linear solver is used, the header \id{sundials/sundials\_dense.h} is
included for access to the underlying generic dense matrix arithmetic
routines.

\section{A skeleton of the user's main program}\label{ss:skeleton_sim}
%%====================================================================
The following is a skeleton of the user's main program (or calling program)
for the integration of a DAE IVP. Most of the steps are independent of the
{\nvector}, {\sunmatrix}, {\sunlinsol}, and {\sunnonlinsol} implementations
used. For the steps that are not, refer to Chapter \ref{s:nvector},
\ref{s:sunmatrix}, \ref{s:sunlinsol}, and \ref{c:sunnonlinsol} for the specific
name of the function to be called or macro to be referenced.
%%
\index{User main program!IDAS@{\idas} usage}
\begin{Steps}

\item
  {\bf Initialize parallel or multi-threaded environment, if appropriate}

  For example, call \id{MPI\_Init} to initialize {\mpi} if used, or
  set \id{num\_threads}, the number of threads to use within the threaded
  vector functions, if used.

\item
  {\bf Set problem dimensions etc.}

  This generally includes the problem size \id{N}, and may include
  the local vector length \id{Nlocal}.

  Note: The variables \id{N} and \id{Nlocal} should be of type \id{sunindextype}.

\item
  {\bf Set vectors of initial values}

  To set the vectors \id{y0} and \id{yp0} to initial values for $y$\ and
  $\dot{y}$, use the appropriate functions defined by the particular
  {\nvector} implementation.

  For native {\sundials} vector implementations
  (except the {\cuda} and {\raja}-based ones),
  use a call of the form \id{y0 = N\_VMake\_***(..., ydata)} if the \id{realtype}
  array \id{ydata} containing the initial values of $y$ already exists.
  Otherwise, create a new vector by making a call of the form
  \id{y0 = N\_VNew\_***(...)}, and then set its elements by accessing
  the underlying data with a call of the form
  \id{ ydata = N\_VGetArrayPointer(y0)}.
  See \S\ref{ss:nvec_ser}-\ref{ss:nvec_pthreads} for details.

  For the {\hypre} and {\petsc} vector wrappers, first create and initialize
  the underlying vector and then create an {\nvector} wrapper with a call
  of the form \id{y0 = N\_VMake\_***(yvec)}, where \id{yvec} is a {\hypre}
  or {\petsc} vector. Note that calls like \id{N\_VNew\_***(...)} and
  \id{N\_VGetArrayPointer(...)} are not available for these vector wrappers.
  See \S\ref{ss:nvec_parhyp} and \S\ref{ss:nvec_petsc} for details.

  If using either the {\cuda}- or {\raja}-based vector implementations
  use a call of the form
  \id{y0 = N\_VMake\_***(..., c)} where \id{c} is a pointer to a \id{suncudavec}
  or \id{sunrajavec} vector class if this class already exists.  Otherwise,
  create a new vector
  by making a call of the form \id{y0 = N\_VNew\_***(...)}, and then set its
  elements by accessing the underlying data where it is located
  with a call of the form
  \id{N\_VGetDeviceArrayPointer\_***} or \id{N\_VGetHostArrayPointer\_***}.
  Note that the vector class will allocate memory on both the host and device
  when instantiated.  See \S\ref{ss:nvec_cuda}-\ref{ss:nvec_raja} for details.

%   If a \id{realtype} array \id{ydata} containing the initial values of $y$
%   already exists, it may be possible to set \id{y0} either with a call of the form
%   \id{y0 = N\_VMake\_***(..., ydata);}
%   or by making a call of the form
%   \id{y0 = N\_VNew\_***(...);}
%   and loading values into the structure defined by \id{NV\_DATA\_***(y0)},
%   provided these functions and macro exist for the {\nvector} module chosen.

  Set the vector \id{yp0} of initial conditions for $\dot{y}$ similarly.

\item\label{i:ida_create}
  {\bf Create {\idas} object}

  Call \id{ida\_mem = }\id{IDACreate}\id{()}
  to create the {\idas} memory block.
  \id{IDACreate} returns a pointer to the {\idas} memory structure.
  See \S\ref{sss:idainit} for details.
  This \id{void *} pointer must then be passed as the first argument
  to all subsequent {\idas} function calls.

\item\label{i:ida_init}
  {\bf Initialize {\idas} solver}

  Call \id{IDAInit}\id{(...)} to provide required problem
  specifications (residual function, initial time, and initial conditions),
  allocate internal memory for {\idas}, and initialize {\idas}.
  \id{IDAInit} returns an error flag to indicate success or an illegal argument
  value.  See \S\ref{sss:idainit} for details.

\item
  {\bf Specify integration tolerances}

  Call \id{IDASStolerances}\id{(...)} or \id{IDASVtolerances}\id{(...)}
  to specify, respectively, a scalar relative tolerance and scalar
  absolute tolerance, or a scalar relative tolerance and a vector of
  absolute tolerances.  Alternatively, call \id{IDAWFtolerances} to
  specify a function which sets directly the weights used in
  evaluating WRMS vector norms.  See \S\ref{sss:idatolerances} for
  details.

\item\label{i:matrix}
  {\bf Create matrix object}

  If a nonlinear solver requiring a linear solver will be used (e.g., the
  default Newton iteration) and the linear solver will be a matrix-based linear
  solver, then a template Jacobian matrix must be created by using the
  appropriate constructor function defined by the particular {\sunmatrix}
  implementation.

  For the {\sundials}-supplied {\sunmatrix} implementations, the
  matrix object may be created using a call of the form

  \id{SUNMatrix J = }\Id{SUNBandMatrix}\id{(...);}

   or

  \id{SUNMatrix J = }\Id{SUNDenseMatrix}\id{(...);}

   or

  \id{SUNMatrix J = }\Id{SUNSparseMatrix}\id{(...);}

  NOTE: The dense, banded, and sparse matrix objects are usable only in a
  serial or threaded environment.

\item\label{i:lin_solver}
  {\bf Create linear solver object}

  If a nonlinear solver requiring a linear solver is chosen (e.g., the default
  Newton iteration), then the desired linear solver object must be created by
  calling the appropriate constructor function defined by the particular
  {\sunlinsol} implementation.

  For any of the {\sundials}-supplied {\sunlinsol} implementations,
  the linear solver object may be created using a call of the form

  \id{SUNLinearSolver LS = SUNLinSol\_*(...);}

  where \id{*} can be replaced with ``Dense'', ``SPGMR'', or other
  options, as discussed in \S\ref{sss:lin_solv_init} and Chapter {\ref{s:sunlinsol}}.

\item
  {\bf Set linear solver optional inputs}

  Call \id{*Set*} functions from the selected linear solver module
  to change optional inputs specific to that linear solver.
  See the documentation for each {\sunlinsol} module in Chapter
  {\ref{s:sunlinsol}} for details.

\item\label{i:lin_solver_interface}
  {\bf Attach linear solver module}

  If a nonlinear solver requiring a linear solver is chosen (e.g., the default
  Newton iteration), then initialize the {\idals} linear solver
  interface by attaching the linear solver object (and matrix object, if
  applicable) with the following call (for details see
  \S\ref{sss:lin_solv_init}):

  \id{ier = }\Id{IDASetLinearSolver}\id{(...);}

\item
  {\bf Set optional inputs}

  Optionally, call \id{IDASet*} functions to change from their default values any
  optional inputs that control the behavior of {\idas}.
  See \S\ref{sss:optin_main} and \S\ref{ss:optional_input} for details.

\item\label{i:nonlin_solver}
  {\bf Create nonlinear solver object} (\textit{optional})

  If using a non-default nonlinear solver (see \S\ref{sss:nonlin_solv_init}),
  then create the desired nonlinear solver object by calling the appropriate
  constructor function defined by the particular {\sunnonlinsol} implementation
  (e.g., \id{NLS = SUNNonlinSol\_***(...);} where \id{***} is the name of the
  nonlinear solver (see Chapter \ref{c:sunnonlinsol} for details).

\item\label{i:nonlin_solver_interface}
  {\bf Attach nonlinear solver module} (\textit{optional})

  If using a non-default nonlinear solver, then initialize the nonlinear solver
  interface by attaching the nonlinear solver object by calling
  \id{ier = }\Id{IDASetNonlinearSolver}\id{(ida\_mem, NLS);} (see
  \S\ref{sss:nonlin_solv_init} for details).

\item
  {\bf Set nonlinear solver optional inputs} (\textit{optional})

  Call the appropriate set functions for the selected nonlinear solver module to
  change optional inputs specific to that nonlinear solver. These \textit{must}
  be called after \id{IDAInit} if using the default nonlinear solver or after
  attaching a new nonlinear solver to {\idas}, otherwise the optional inputs will
  be overridden by {\idas} defaults. See Chapter \ref{c:sunnonlinsol} for more
  information on optional inputs.

\item
  {\bf Correct initial values}

  Optionally, call \id{IDACalcIC} to correct the initial values
  \id{y0} and \id{yp0} passed to \id{IDAInit}.  See \S\ref{ss:idacalcic}.
  Also see \S\ref{sss:optin_iccalc} for relevant optional input calls.

\item
  {\bf Specify rootfinding problem}
  \index{Rootfinding}

  Optionally, call \id{IDARootInit} to initialize a rootfinding problem
  to be solved during the integration of the DAE system.
  See \S\ref{ss:idarootinit} for details, and see \S\ref{sss:optin_root}
  for relevant optional input calls.

\item
  {\bf Advance solution in time}

  For each point at which output is desired, call
  \id{flag = }\Id{IDASolve}\id{(ida\_mem, tout, \&tret, yret, ypret, itask)}.
  Here \id{itask} specifies the return mode.  The vector \id{yret}
  (which can be the same as the vector \id{y0} above) will contain $y(t)$,
  while the vector \id{ypret} (which can be the same as the vector \id{yp0}
  above) will contain $\dot{y}(t)$.
  See \S\ref{sss:idasolve} for details.

\item
  {\bf Get optional outputs}

  Call \id{IDA*Get*} functions to obtain optional output.
  See \S\ref{ss:optional_output} for details.

\item
  {\bf Deallocate memory for solution vectors}

  Upon completion of the integration, deallocate memory for the vectors \id{yret}
  and \id{ypret} (or \id{y} and \id{yp}) by calling the appropriate destructor
  function defined by the {\nvector} implementation:

  \id{N\_VDestroy(yret);}

  and similarly for \id{ypret}.

\item
  {\bf Free solver memory}

  \Id{IDAFree}\id{(\&ida\_mem)} to free the memory allocated for {\idas}.

\item
  {\bf Free nonlinear solver memory} (\textit{optional})

  If a non-default nonlinear solver was used, then call
  \Id{SUNNonlinSolFree}\id{(NLS)} to free any memory allocated for the
  {\sunnonlinsol} object.

\item
  {\bf Free linear solver and matrix memory}

  Call \Id{SUNLinSolFree} and \ID{SUNMatDestroy} to free any memory
  allocated for the linear solver and matrix objects created above.

\item
  {\bf Finalize MPI, if used}

  Call \id{MPI\_Finalize()} to terminate MPI.

\end{Steps}

\section{User-callable functions}\label{ss:callable_fct_sim}
%%==========================================================

This section describes the {\idas} functions that are called by the
user to set up and solve a DAE. Some of these are required. However,
starting with \S\ref{ss:optional_input}, the functions listed involve
optional inputs/outputs or restarting, and those paragraphs can be
skipped for a casual use of {\idas}. In any case, refer to
\S\ref{ss:skeleton_sim} for the correct order of these calls.

On an error, each user-callable function returns a negative value and
sends an error message to the error handler routine, which prints the
message on \id{stderr} by default. However, the user can set a file
as error output or can provide his own error handler function (see
\S\ref{sss:optin_main}).

\subsection{IDAS initialization and deallocation functions}
\label{sss:idainit}
%%
The following three functions must be called in the order listed. The last one
is to be called only after the DAE solution is complete, as it frees the {\idas}

    is the initial value of $y$.
  \item[yp0] (\id{N\_Vector})
    is the initial value of $\dot{y}$.
  \end{args}
}
{
  The return value \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) will be one of the following:
  \begin{args}[IDA\_ILL\_INPUT]
  \item[\Id{IDA\_SUCCESS}]
    The call to \id{IDAInit} was successful.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_MEM\_NULL}]
    The {\idas} memory block was not initialized through a previous call to
    \id{IDACreate}.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_MEM\_FAIL}]
    A memory allocation request has failed.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_ILL\_INPUT}]
    An input argument to \id{IDAInit} has an illegal value.
  \end{args}
}
{
  If an error occurred, \id{IDAInit} also sends an error message to the
  error handler function.
}
%%
%%
\ucfunction{IDAFree}
{
  IDAFree(\&ida\_mem);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDAFree} frees the pointer allocated by
  a previous call to \id{IDACreate}.
}
{
  The argument is the pointer to the {\idas} memory block (of type \id{void *}).
}
{
  The function \id{IDAFree} has no return value.
}
{}


%%==============================================================================
\subsection{IDAS tolerance specification functions}\label{sss:idatolerances}
%%==============================================================================
%%
One of the following three functions must be called to specify the
integration tolerances (or directly specify the weights used in
evaluating WRMS vector norms).  Note that this call must be made after
the call to \id{IDAInit}.
%%
\ucfunction{IDASStolerances}
{
  flag = IDASStolerances(ida\_mem, reltol, abstol);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDASStolerances} specifies scalar relative and absolute
  tolerances.

  \begin{args}[ida\_mem]
  \item[ida\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the {\idas} memory block returned by \id{IDACreate}.
  \item[reltol] (\id{realtype})

    The {\idas} memory block was not initialized through a previous call to
    \id{IDACreate}.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_NO\_MALLOC}]
    The allocation function \id{IDAInit} has not been called.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_ILL\_INPUT}]
    One of the input tolerances was negative.
  \end{args}

{}
%%
%%
\ucfunction{IDASVtolerances}
{
  flag = IDASVtolerances(ida\_mem, reltol, abstol);

  vector absolute tolerances.
}
{
  \begin{args}[ida\_mem]
  \item[ida\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the {\idas} memory block returned by \id{IDACreate}.
  \item[reltol] (\id{realtype})
    is the scalar relative error tolerance.

    The {\idas} memory block was not initialized through a previous call to
    \id{IDACreate}.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_NO\_MALLOC}]
    The allocation function \id{IDAInit} has not been called.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_ILL\_INPUT}]
    The relative error tolerance was negative or the absolute tolerance
    had a negative component.
  \end{args}
}
{
  This choice of tolerances is important when the absolute error tolerance needs to
  be different for each component of the state vector $y$.
}
%%
%%
\ucfunction{IDAWFtolerances}
{
  flag = IDAWFtolerances(ida\_mem, efun);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDAWFtolerances} specifies a user-supplied function \id{efun}
  that sets the multiplicative error weights $W_i$ for use in the weighted
  RMS norm, which are normally defined by Eq. (\ref{e:errwt}).
}
{
  \begin{args}[ida\_mem]
  \item[ida\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the {\idas} memory block returned by \id{IDACreate}.
  \item[efun] (\id{IDAEwtFn})

{\bf General advice on choice of tolerances.}
For many users, the appropriate choices for tolerance values in
\id{reltol} and \id{abstol} are a concern.  The following pieces of
advice are relevant.

(1) The scalar relative tolerance \id{reltol} is to be set to control relative
errors.  So \id{reltol}=$10^{-4}$ means that errors are controlled to .01\%.  We
do not recommend using \id{reltol} larger than $10^{-3}$.  On the other hand,
\id{reltol} should not be so small that it is comparable to the unit roundoff
of the machine arithmetic (generally around $10^{-15}$).

(2) The absolute tolerances \id{abstol} (whether scalar or vector) need to
be set to control absolute errors when any components of the solution
vector \id{y} may be so small that pure relative error control is
meaningless.  For example, if \id{y[i]} starts at some nonzero value, but in time
decays to zero, then pure relative error control on \id{y[i]} makes no sense
(and is overly costly) after \id{y[i]} is below some noise level.  Then
\id{abstol} (if scalar) or \id{abstol[i]} (if a vector) needs to be set to that
noise level.  If the different components have different noise levels,
then \id{abstol} should be a vector.  See the example \id{idasRoberts\_dns} in the
{\idas} package, and the discussion of it in the {\idas} Examples document
\cite{idas_ex}.
In that problem, the three components vary between 0 and 1, and have
different noise levels; hence the \id{abstol} vector.  It is impossible to
give any general advice on \id{abstol} values, because the appropriate noise
levels are completely problem-dependent.  The user or modeler hopefully has
some idea as to what those noise levels are.

(3) Finally, it is important to pick all the tolerance values conservatively,
because they control the error committed on each individual time step.
The final (global) errors are a sort of accumulation of those
per-step errors.  A good rule of thumb is to reduce the tolerances by a
factor of .01 from the actual desired limits on errors.  So if you
want .01\% accuracy (globally), a good choice is \id{reltol}$=10^{-6}$.
But in any case, it is a good idea to do a few experiments with
the tolerances to see how the computed solution values vary as
tolerances are reduced.

\vspace{0.1in}
\index{tolerances}
{\bf Advice on controlling unphysical negative values.}
In many applications, some components in the true solution are always
positive or non-negative, though at times very small.  In the numerical
solution, however, small negative (hence unphysical) values can then
occur.  In most cases, these values are harmless, and simply need to
be controlled, not eliminated. The following pieces of advice are relevant.

(1) The way to control the size of unwanted negative computed values
is with tighter absolute tolerances.  Again this requires some
knowledge of the noise level of these components, which may or may not
be different for different components.  Some experimentation may be
needed.

(2) If output plots or tables are being generated, and it is important
to avoid having negative numbers appear there (for the sake of avoiding
a long explanation of them, if nothing else), then eliminate them, but
only in the context of the output medium.  Then the internal values carried
by the solver are unaffected.  Remember that a small negative value in \id{yret}
returned by {\idas}, with magnitude comparable to \id{abstol} or less,
is equivalent to zero as far as the computation is concerned.

(3) The user's residual routine \id{res} should never change a
negative value in the solution vector \id{yy} to a non-negative value,
as a "solution" to this problem.  This can cause instability.  If the
\id{res} routine cannot tolerate a zero or negative value (e.g., because
there is a square root or log of it), then the offending value should
be changed to zero or a tiny positive number in a temporary variable
(not in the input \id{yy} vector) for the purposes of computing $F(t,y,\dot{y})$.

(4) {\idas} provides the option of enforcing positivity or non-negativity
on components.  Also, such constraints can be enforced by use of the
recoverable error return feature in the user-supplied residual function.
However, because these options involve some extra overhead cost, they
should only be exercised if the use of absolute tolerances to control
the computed values is unsuccessful.

\subsection{Linear solver interface functions}\label{sss:lin_solv_init}

As previously explained, if the nonlinear solver requires the solution of
linear systems of the form (\ref{e:DAE_Newtoncorr}) (e.g., the default Newton
iteration, then solution of these linear systems is handled with the
{\idals} linear solver interface.  This interface supports all valid
{\sunlinsol} modules.  Here, matrix-based {\sunlinsol} modules utilize
{\sunmatrix} objects to store the Jacobian matrix
$J = \partial{F}/\partial{y} + \alpha \partial{F}/\partial{\dot{y}}$
and factorizations used throughout the solution process.  Conversely,
matrix-free {\sunlinsol} modules instead use iterative methods to
solve the linear systems of equations, and only require the
\emph{action} of the Jacobian on a vector, $Jv$.

With most iterative linear solvers, preconditioning can be done on the
left only, on the right only, on both the left and the right, or not
at all.  The exceptions to this rule are {\spfgmr} that supports right
preconditioning only and {\pcg} that performs symmetric
preconditioning.  However, in {\idas} only left preconditioning is
supported.  For the specification of a preconditioner, see the
iterative linear solver sections in \S\ref{ss:optional_input} and
\S\ref{ss:user_fct_sim}. A preconditioner matrix $P$ must approximate
the Jacobian $J$, at least crudely.

\index{IDAS@{\idas} linear solvers!selecting one|(}
To specify a generic linear solver to {\idas}, after the call to
\id{IDACreate} but before any calls to \id{IDASolve}, the user's
program must create the appropriate {\sunlinsol} object and call
the function \Id{IDASetLinearSolver}, as documented below.
To create the \id{SUNLinearSolver} object, the user may call one of
the {\sundials}-packaged {\sunlinsol} module constructor routines via
a call of the form

\begin{verbatim}
      SUNLinearSolver LS = SUNLinSol_*(...);
\end{verbatim}

The current list of such constructor routines includes
\Id{SUNLinSol\_Dense},
\Id{SUNLinSol\_Band},\\ \noindent
\Id{SUNLinSol\_LapackDense},
\Id{SUNLinSol\_LapackBand},
\Id{SUNLinSol\_KLU},
\Id{SUNLinSol\_SuperLUMT},\\ \noindent
\Id{SUNLinSol\_SPGMR},
\Id{SUNLinSol\_SPFGMR},
\Id{SUNLinSol\_SPBCGS},
\Id{SUNLinSol\_SPTFQMR}, and
\Id{SUNLinSol\_PCG}.

Alternately, a user-supplied
\id{SUNLinearSolver} module may be created and used instead.  The use
of each of the generic linear solvers involves certain constants,
functions and possibly some macros, that are likely to be needed in
the user code.  These are available in the corresponding header file
associated with the specific {\sunmatrix} or {\sunlinsol} module in
question, as described in Chapters \ref{s:sunmatrix} and
\ref{s:sunlinsol}.

Once this solver object has been constructed, the user should attach
it to {\idas} via a call to \Id{IDASetLinearSolver}.  The first argument 
passed to this function is the {\idas} memory pointer returned by
\id{IDACreate}; the second argument is the desired {\sunlinsol} object
to use for solving systems.  The third argument is an optional
{\sunmatrix} object to accompany matrix-based {\sunlinsol} inputs (for
matrix-free linear solvers, the third argument should be \id{NULL}).
A call to this function initializes the {\idals} linear solver
interface, linking it to the main {\idas} integrator, and allows the
user to specify additional parameters and routines pertinent to their
choice of linear solver.

\subsection{Nonlinear solver interface function}
\label{sss:nonlin_solv_init}

By default {\idas} uses the {\sunnonlinsol} implementation of Newton's method
defined by the {\sunnonlinsolnewton} module (see \S\ref{s:sunnonlinsol_newton}).
To specify a different nonlinear solver in {\idas}, the user's program must
create a {\sunnonlinsol} object by calling the appropriate constructor routine.
The user must then attach the {\sunnonlinsol} object to {\idas} by calling
\Id{IDASetNonlinearSolver}, as documented below.

When changing the nonlinear solver in {\idas}, \id{IDASetNonlinearSolver} must
be called after \id{IDAInit}. If any calls to \id{IDASolve} have been made, then
{\idas} will need to be reinitialized by calling \id{IDAReInit} to ensure
that the nonlinear solver is initialized correctly before any subsequent calls
to \id{IDASolve}.

The first argument passed to the routine \id{IDASetNonlinearSolver} is the
{\idas} memory pointer returned by \id{IDACreate} and the second argument is
the {\sunnonlinsol} object to use for solving the nonlinear system
\ref{e:DAE_nls}.
A call to this function attaches the nonlinear solver to the main {\idas}
integrator. We note that at present, the {\sunnonlinsol} object
\emph{must be of type} \id{SUNNONLINEARSOLVER\_ROOTFIND}.

\ucfunction{IDASetNonlinearSolver}

\subsection{Initial condition calculation function}\label{ss:idacalcic}

\id{IDACalcIC} calculates corrected initial conditions for the DAE system
for certain index-one problems including a class of systems of semi-implicit
form.  (See \S{\ref{ss:ivp_sol} and Ref. \cite{BHP:98}.)
It uses Newton iteration combined with a linesearch algorithm.
Calling \id{IDACalcIC} is optional. It is only necessary when the
initial conditions do not satisfy the given system.  Thus if
\id{y0} and \id{yp0} are known to satisfy $F(t_0, y_0, \dot{y}_0) = 0$,
then a call to \id{IDACalcIC} is generally {\em not} necessary.

A call to the function \id{IDACalcIC} must be preceded by successful calls to
\id{IDACreate} and \id{IDAInit} (or \id{IDAReInit}), and by a
successful call to the linear system solver specification function.
The call to \id{IDACalcIC} should precede the call(s) to \id{IDASolve}
for the given problem.

    the algebraic components of $y$ and differential components of $\dot{y}$,
    given the differential components of $y$.
    This option requires that the \id{N\_Vector} \id{id} was set through
    \id{IDASetId}, specifying the differential and algebraic components.

    \id{icopt}$ = $\ID{IDA\_Y\_INIT} directs \id{IDACalcIC} to compute all
    components of $y$, given $\dot{y}$.  In this case, \id{id} is not required.

  \item[tout1] (\id{realtype})
    is the first value of $t$ at which a solution will be requested (from
    \id{IDASolve}).  This value is needed here only to determine the direction of
    integration and rough scale in the independent variable $t$.

roots of a set of user-defined functions. To activate the rootfinding
algorithm, call the following function.  This is normally called only

\subsection{Optional input functions}\label{ss:optional_input}

There are numerous optional input parameters that control the behavior

Table \ref{t:optional_input} lists all optional input functions in {\idas} which
are then described in detail in the remainder of this section.
For the most casual use of {\idas}, the reader can skip to \S\ref{ss:user_fct_sim}.

We note that, on an error return, all these functions also send an error message to
the error handler function.
\index{error messages}
We also note that all error return values are negative,
so a test \id{flag} $<0$ will catch any error.

\subsubsection{Linear solver interface optional input functions}
\label{sss:optin_ls}
\index{optional input!generic linear solver interface|(}
\index{IDALS@{\idals} linear solver interface!optional input|(}

The mathematical explanation of the linear solver methods
available to {\idas} is provided in \S\ref{ss:ivp_sol}.  We
group the user-callable routines into four categories: general
routines concerning the overall {\idals} linear solver interface,
optional inputs for matrix-based linear solvers, optional inputs for
matrix-free linear solvers, and optional inputs for iterative linear
solvers.  We note that the matrix-based and matrix-free groups are
mutually exclusive, whereas the ``iterative'' tag can apply to either
case.

\index{optional input!matrix-based linear solver|(}
\index{IDALS@{\idals} linear solver interface!Jacobian approximation used by}
When using matrix-based linear solver modules, the {\idals} solver
interface needs a function to compute an approximation to the Jacobian
matrix $J(t,y,\dot{y})$.  This function must be of type
\id{IDALsJacFn}.  The user can supply a Jacobian function, or if using a
dense or banded matrix $J$ can use the default internal difference
quotient approximation
\index{Jacobian approximation function!difference quotient}
that comes with the {\idals} interface.
To specify a user-supplied Jacobian function \id{jac}, {\idals} provides
the function \id{IDASetJacFn}.
The {\idals} interface passes the pointer \id{user\_data}
to the Jacobian function. This allows the user to
create an arbitrary structure with relevant problem data and access it
during the execution of the user-supplied Jacobian function, without
using global data in the program.
The pointer \id{user\_data} may be specified through \id{IDASetUserData}.
%%
\index{Jacobian approximation function!user-supplied}
\ucfunction{IDASetJacFn}
{
  flag = IDASetJacFn(ida\_mem, jac);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDASetJacFn} specifies the Jacobian
  approximation function to be used for a matrix-based solver within
  the {\idals} interface.
}
{
  \begin{args}[ida\_mem]
  \item[ida\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the {\idas} memory block.
  \item[jac] (\id{IDALsJacFn})
    user-defined Jacobian approximation function.
  \end{args}
}
{
  The return value \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) is one of
  \begin{args}
  \item[\Id{IDALS\_SUCCESS}]
    The optional value has been successfully set.
  \item[\Id{IDALS\_MEM\_NULL}]
    The \id{ida\_mem} pointer is \id{NULL}.
  \item[\Id{IDALS\_LMEM\_NULL}]
    The {\idals} linear solver interface has not been initialized.
  \end{args}
}
{
  This function must be called \emph{after} the {\idals} linear solver
  interface has been initialized through a call to
  \id{IDASetLinearSolver}.

  By default, {\idals} uses an internal difference quotient function
  for dense and band matrices.  If \id{NULL} is passed to \id{jac},
  this default function is used.  An error will occur if no \id{jac}
  is supplied when using other matrix types.

  The function type \id{IDALsJacFn} is described in \S\ref{ss:jacFn}.

  The previous routine \Id{IDADlsSetJacFn} is now a wrapper for this
  routine, and may still be used for backward-compatibility.  However,
  this will be deprecated in future releases, so we recommend that
  users transition to the new routine name soon.

%%
\index{optional input!matrix-free linear solver|(}
\index{IDALS@{\idals} linear solver interface!Jacobian approximation used by}
When using matrix-free linear solver modules, the {\idals} solver
interface requires a function to compute an approximation to the
product between the Jacobian matrix $J(t,y)$ and a vector $v$. The
user can supply a Jacobian-times-vector approximation function, 
or use the default internal difference quotient function
\index{Jacobian approximation function!Jacobian times vector!difference quotient}
that comes with the {\idals} solver interface.  A user-defined
Jacobian-vector function must be of type \id{IDALsJacTimesVecFn} 
and can be specified through a call to \id{IDASetJacTimes}
(see \S\ref{ss:jtimesFn} for specification details).
The evaluation and processing of any Jacobian-related data needed by
the user's Jacobian-times-vector function may be done in the optional
user-supplied function \id{jtsetup} (see \S\ref{ss:jtsetupFn} for
specification details).
%% 
The pointer \id{user\_data} received through \id{IDASetUserData} (or a
pointer to \id{NULL} if \id{user\_data} was not specified)

\index{preconditioning!user-supplied|(}
When using an iterative linear solver, the user may supply a
preconditioning operator to aid in solution of the system.  This
operator consists of two user-supplied functions, \id{psetup} and
\id{psolve}, that are supplied to {\ida} using the function
\Id{IDASetPreconditioner}.  The \id{psetup} function supplied to
this routine should handle evaluation and preprocessing of any
Jacobian data needed by the user's preconditioner solve function,
\id{psolve}.  Both of these functions are fully specified in
\S\ref{ss:user_fct_sim}.  The user data pointer received through
\id{IDASetUserData} (or a pointer to \id{NULL} if user data was not
specified) is passed to the \id{psetup} and \id{psolve} functions.
This allows the user to create an arbitrary structure with relevant
problem data and access it during the execution of the user-supplied
preconditioner functions without using global data in the program.

Also, as described in \S\ref{ss:ivp_sol}, the {\idals} interface
requires that iterative linear solvers stop when the norm of the
preconditioned residual satisfies
\[
  \|r\| \le \frac{\epsilon_L \epsilon}{10}
\]
where $\epsilon$ is the nonlinear solver tolerance, and the default
$\epsilon_L = 0.05$; this value may be modified by the user through
the \id{IDASetEpsLin} function.

\subsection{Optional output functions}\label{ss:optional_output}

{\idas} provides an extensive list of functions that can be used to obtain
solver performance information.  Table \ref{t:optional_output} lists all optional
output functions in {\idas}, which are then described in detail in the remainder
of this section.

Some of the optional outputs, especially the various counters, can be
very useful in determining how successful the {\idas} solver is in
doing its job.  For example, the counters \id{nsteps} and \id{nrevals}
provide a rough measure of the overall cost of a given run, and can be
compared among runs with differing input options to suggest which set
of options is most efficient.  The ratio \id{nniters/nsteps} measures
the performance of the nonlinear solver in solving the nonlinear
systems at each time step; typical values for this range from 1.1 to
1.8.  The ratio \id{njevals/nniters} (in the case of a matrix-based linear
solver), and the ratio \id{npevals/nniters} (in the case of an
iterative linear solver) measure the overall degree of nonlinearity
in these systems, and also the quality of the approximate Jacobian or
preconditioner being used.  Thus, for example, \id{njevals/nniters}
can indicate if a user-supplied Jacobian is inaccurate, if this ratio
is larger than for the case of the corresponding internal Jacobian.
The ratio \id{nliters/nniters} measures the performance of the Krylov
iterative linear solver, and thus (indirectly) the quality of the
preconditioner.

\subsubsection{Main solver optional output functions}\label{sss:optout_main}
\index{optional output!solver|(}
%%
{\idas} provides several user-callable functions that can be used to obtain
different quantities that may be of interest to the user, such as solver workspace
requirements, solver performance statistics, as well as additional data from
the {\idas} memory block (a suggested tolerance scaling factor, the error weight
vector, and the vector of estimated local errors). Also provided are functions to
extract statistics related to the performance of the {\sunnonlinsol} nonlinear solver
being used. As a convenience, additional extraction functions provide the optional
outputs in groups.
%%
These optional output functions are described next.

\ucfunction{IDAGetWorkSpace}
{
  flag = IDAGetWorkSpace(ida\_mem, \&lenrw, \&leniw);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDAGetWorkSpace} returns the
  {\idas} real and integer workspace sizes.
}
{
  \begin{args}[ida\_mem]
  \item[ida\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the {\idas} memory block.
  \item[lenrw] (\id{long int})
    number of real values in the {\idas} workspace.
  \item[leniw] (\id{long int})
    number of integer values in the {\idas} workspace.
  \end{args}
}
{
  The return value \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) is one of
  \begin{args}[IDA\_MEM\_NULL]
  \item[IDA\_SUCCESS]
    The optional output value has been successfully set.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_MEM\_NULL}]
    The \id{ida\_mem} pointer is \id{NULL}.
  \end{args}
}
{
  \index{memory requirements!IDAS@{\idas} solver}
  In terms of the problem size $N$, the maximum method order \id{maxord}, and
  the number \id{nrtfn} of root functions (see \S\ref{ss:idarootinit}),
  the actual size of the real workspace, in \id{realtype} words, is
  given by the following:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item base value: \id{lenrw} $= 55 + (m + 6)*N_r + 3*$\id{nrtfn};
  \item with \id{IDASVtolerances}: \id{lenrw} $=$ \id{lenrw} $+ N_r$;
  \item with constraint checking (see \id{IDASetConstraints}):
    \id{lenrw} $=$ \id{lenrw} $+ N_r$;
  \item with \id{id} specified (see \id{IDASetId}):
    \id{lenrw} $=$ \id{lenrw} $+ N_r$;
  \end{itemize}
  where $m = \max($\id{maxord}$,3)$, and
  $N_r$ is the number of real words in one \id{N\_Vector} ($\approx N$).

  The size of the integer workspace (without distinction between \id{int}
  and \id{long int} words) is given by:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item base value: \id{leniw} $= 38 + (m + 6)*N_i ~ + ~ $\id{nrtfn};
  \item with \id{IDASVtolerances}: \id{leniw} $=$ \id{leniw} $+ N_i$;
  \item with constraint checking: \id{lenrw} $=$ \id{lenrw} $+ N_i$;
  \item with \id{id} specified: \id{lenrw} $=$ \id{lenrw} $+ N_i$;
  \end{itemize}
  where $N_i$ is the number of integer words in one \id{N\_Vector}
  (= 1 for {\nvecs} and 2*\id{npes} for {\nvecp} on \id{npes} processors).

  For the default value of \id{maxord}, with no rootfinding, no \id{id},
  no constraints, and with no call to \id{IDASVtolerances}, these lengths are
  given roughly by: \id{lenrw} $= 55 + 11N$, \id{leniw} $= 49$.

  Note that additional memory is allocated if quadratures and/or forward sensitivity
  integration is enabled. See \S\ref{ss:quad_init} and \S\ref{ss:sensi_init}
  for more details.

  whose components are the products of the components of these two vectors.

  causing the failures are those with largest values for the products,
  denoted loosely as \id{eweight[i]*ele[i]}.

\subsection{IDAS reinitialization function}\label{sss:idareinit}
\index{reinitialization}

The function \ID{IDAReInit} reinitializes the main {\idas} solver for
the solution of a new problem, where a prior call to \Id{IDAInit} has
been made. The new problem must have the same size as the previous one.
\id{IDAReInit} performs the same input checking and initializations
that \id{IDAInit} does, but does no memory allocation, as it assumes that
the existing internal memory is sufficient for the new problem.
A call to \id{IDAReInit} deletes the solution history that was stored
internally during the previous integration.  Following a successful call to
\id{IDAReInit}, call \id{IDASolve} again for the solution of the new problem.

The use of \id{IDAReInit} requires that the maximum method order,
\Id{maxord}, is no larger for the new problem than for the problem
specified in the last call to \id{IDAInit}.  In addition, the same
{\nvector} module set for the previous problem
will be reused for the new problem.

If there are changes to the linear solver specifications, make the
appropriate calls to either the linear solver objects themselves, or
to the {\idals} interface routines, as described in
\S\ref{sss:lin_solv_init}.

If there are changes to any optional inputs, make the appropriate
\id{IDASet***} calls, as described in \S\ref{ss:optional_input}.
Otherwise, all solver inputs set previously remain in effect.

One important use of the \id{IDAReInit} function is in the treating
of jump discontinuities in the residual function.  Except in cases of
fairly small jumps, it is usually more efficient to stop at each point
of discontinuity and restart the integrator with a readjusted DAE
model, using a call to \id{IDAReInit}.  To stop when the location of
the discontinuity is known, simply make that location a value of tout.
To stop when the location of the discontinuity is determined by the
solution, use the rootfinding feature.  In either case, it is critical
that the residual function {\it not} incorporate the discontinuity, but
rather have a smooth extention over the discontinuity, so that the
step across it (and subsequent rootfinding, if used) can be done
efficiently.  Then use a switch within the residual function (communicated
through \id{user\_data}) that can be flipped between the stopping of
the integration and the restart, so that the restarted problem uses
the new values (which have jumped).  Similar comments apply if there
is to be a jump in the dependent variable vector.

\subsection{Residual function}\label{ss:resFn}

\usfunction{IDAResFn}
{
  typedef int (*IDAResFn)(&realtype tt, N\_Vector yy, N\_Vector yp,  \\
                          &N\_Vector rr, void *user\_data);

  of the independent variable $t$, state vector $y$, and derivative $\dot{y}$.
}
{
  \begin{args}[user\_data]
  \item[tt]
    is the current value of the independent variable.
  \item[yy]
    is the current value of the dependent variable vector, $y(t)$.
  \item[yp]
    is the current value of $\dot{y}(t)$.
  \item[rr]
    is the output residual vector $F(t,y,\dot{y})$.
  \item[user\_data]
    is a pointer to user data, the same as the \Id{user\_data}
    parameter passed to \id{IDASetUserData}.
  \end{args}
}
{
  An \id{IDAResFn} function type should return a value of $0$ if successful,
  a positive value if a recoverable error occurred (e.g., \id{yy} has an illegal
  value), or a negative value if a nonrecoverable error occurred.
  In the last case, the integrator halts.
  If a recoverable error occurred, the integrator will attempt to correct and retry.

{
  A recoverable failure error return from the \id{IDAResFn} is typically used to
  flag a value of the dependent variable \id{y} that is ``illegal'' in
  some way (e.g., negative where only a non-negative value is physically
  meaningful).  If such a return is made, {\idas} will attempt to recover
  (possibly repeating the nonlinear solve, or reducing the step size)
  in order to avoid this recoverable error return.

  For efficiency reasons, the DAE residual function is not evaluated
  at the converged solution of the nonlinear solver. Therefore, in general, a
  recoverable error in that converged value cannot be corrected.  (It may be
  detected when the right-hand side function is called the first time during
  the following integration step, but a successful step cannot be undone.)
  However, if the user program also includes quadrature integration, the
  state variables can be checked for legality in the call to
  \id{IDAQuadRhsFn}, which is called at the converged solution of the
  nonlinear system, and therefore {\idas} can be flagged to attempt
  to recover from such a situation. Also, if sensitivity analysis is
  performed with the staggered method, the DAE residual
  function is called at the converged solution of the nonlinear system,
  and a recoverable error at that point can be flagged, and {\idas}
  will then try to correct it.

  Allocation of memory for \id{yp} is handled within {\idas}.

  A \id{IDAErrHandlerFn} function has no return value.

\subsection{Error weight function}

\index{tolerances}
As an alternative to providing the relative and absolute tolerances, the user may

multiplicative weights $W_i$ used in the WRMS norm
$\|\ v \|_{\mbox{\scriptsize WRMS}} = \sqrt{(1/N)\sum_1^N (W_i \cdot v_i)^2}$.
These weights will used in place of those defined by Eq. (\ref{e:errwt}).

\subsection{Rootfinding function}

\subsection{Jacobian construction (matrix-based linear solvers)}
\label{ss:jacFn}
\index{Jacobian approximation function!user-supplied|(}
If a matrix-based linear solver module is used (i.e. a non-\id{NULL}
{\sunmatrix} object was supplied to \Id{IDASetLinearSolver}), the user may
provide a function of type \ID{IDALsJacFn} defined as follows:
%%
\usfunction{IDALsJacFn}
{
  typedef int (*IDALsJacFn)(&realtype tt, realtype cj,\\
                            &N\_Vector yy, N\_Vector yp, N\_Vector rr, \\
                            &SUNMatrix Jac, void *user\_data,  \\
                            &N\_Vector tmp1, N\_Vector tmp2, N\_Vector tmp3);
}
{
  This function computes the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the DAE system (or an
  approximation to it), defined by Eq. (\ref{e:DAE_Jacobian}).
}
{
  \begin{args}[user\_data]
  \item[tt]
    is the current value of the independent variable $t$.
  \item[cj]
    is the scalar in the system Jacobian, proportional to the inverse of the
    step size ($\alpha$ in Eq. (\ref{e:DAE_Jacobian}) ).
  \item[yy]
    is the current value of the dependent variable vector, $y(t)$.
  \item[yp]
    is the current value of $\dot{y}(t)$.
  \item[rr]
    is the current value of the residual vector $F(t,y,\dot{y})$.
  \item[Jac]
    is the output (approximate) Jacobian matrix (of type \id{SUNMatrix}),
    $J = \partial{F}/\partial{y} + cj ~ \partial{F}/\partial{\dot{y}}$.
  \item[user\_data]
    is a pointer to user data, the same as the \id{user\_data}
    parameter passed to \id{IDASetUserData}.
  \item[tmp1]
  \item[tmp2]
  \item[tmp3]
    are pointers to memory allocated for variables of type \id{N\_Vector}
    which can be used by \id{IDALsJacFn} function
    as temporary storage or work space.
  \end{args}
}
{
  An \id{IDALsJacFn} should return $0$ if successful,
  a positive value if a recoverable error occurred, or a negative value
  if a nonrecoverable error occurred.

  In the case of a recoverable eror return,
  the integrator will attempt to recover by reducing the stepsize,
  and hence changing $\alpha$ in (\ref{e:DAE_Jacobian}).
}
{
  Information regarding the structure of the specific {\sunmatrix}
  structure (e.g.,~number of rows, upper/lower bandwidth, sparsity
  type) may be obtained through using the implementation-specific
  {\sunmatrix} interface functions (see Chapter \ref{s:sunmatrix} for
  details).

  Prior to calling the user-supplied Jacobian function, the Jacobian
  matrix $J(t,y)$ is zeroed out, so only nonzero elements need to be
  loaded into \id{Jac}.

  If the user's \id{IDALsJacFn} function uses difference
  quotient approximations, it may need to access quantities not in the
  call list. These quantities may include the current stepsize, the error weights, etc.
  To obtain these, the user will need to add a pointer to \id{ida\_mem}
  to \id{user\_data} and then use the \id{IDAGet*} functions described in
  \S\ref{sss:optout_main}. The unit roundoff can be accessed as
  \id{UNIT\_ROUNDOFF} defined in \id{sundials\_types.h}.

  {\bf dense:}\\
  A user-supplied dense Jacobian function must load the \id{Neq} $\times$ \id{Neq}
  dense matrix \id{Jac} with an approximation to the Jacobian matrix $J(t,y,\dot{y})$
  at the point (\id{tt}, \id{yy}, \id{yp}).  The accessor macros \Id{SM\_ELEMENT\_D}
  and \Id{SM\_COLUMN\_D} allow the user to read and write dense matrix
  elements without making explicit references to the underlying
  representation of the {\sunmatdense} type.
  \id{SM\_ELEMENT\_D(J, i, j)} references the (\id{i}, \id{j})-th
  element of the dense matrix \id{Jac} (with \id{i}, \id{j }$= 0\ldots
  \id{N}-1$). This macro is meant for small problems for which efficiency
  of access is not a major concern.  Thus, in terms of the indices $m$
  and $n$ ranging from $1$ to $N$, the Jacobian element $J_{m,n}$ can
  be set using the statement \id{SM\_ELEMENT\_D(J, m-1, n-1) =}
  $J_{m,n}$.  Alternatively, \id{SM\_COLUMN\_D(J, j)} returns a
  pointer to the first element of the \id{j}-th column of \id{Jac}
  (with \id{j }$= 0\ldots \id{N}-1$), and the elements of the \id{j}-th column
  can then be accessed using ordinary array indexing.  Consequently,
  $J_{m,n}$ can be loaded using the statements
  \id{col\_n = SM\_COLUMN\_D(J, n-1);} \id{col\_n[m-1] =} $J_{m,n}$.
  For large problems, it is more efficient to use \id{SM\_COLUMN\_D}
  than to use \id{SM\_ELEMENT\_D}.  Note that both of these macros
  number rows and columns starting from $0$.  The {\sunmatdense} type
  and accessor macros are documented in \S\ref{ss:sunmat_dense}.

  {\bf banded}:\\
  A user-supplied banded Jacobian function must load the \id{Neq} $\times$ \id{Neq}
  banded matrix \id{Jac} with an approximation to the Jacobian matrix $J(t,y,\dot{y})$
  at the point (\id{tt}, \id{yy}, \id{yp}).
  The accessor macros \Id{SM\_ELEMENT\_B},
  \Id{SM\_COLUMN\_B}, and \Id{SM\_COLUMN\_ELEMENT\_B} allow the user
  to read and write banded matrix elements without making specific
  references to the underlying representation of the {\sunmatband}
  type.  \id{SM\_ELEMENT\_B(J, i, j)} references the (\id{i},
  \id{j})-th element of the banded matrix \id{Jac}, counting from $0$.
  This macro is meant for use in small problems for which efficiency
  of access is not a major concern.  Thus, in terms of the indices $m$
  and $n$ ranging from $1$ to $\id{N}$ with $(m,n)$ within the band defined
  by \id{mupper} and \id{mlower}, the Jacobian element $J_{m,n}$ can
  be loaded using the statement \id{SM\_ELEMENT\_B(J, m-1, n-1) =}
  $J_{m,n}$. The elements within the band are those with \id{-mupper}
  $\le$ \id{m-n} $\le$ \id{mlower}. Alternatively,
  \id{SM\_COLUMN\_B(J, j)} returns a pointer to the diagonal element
  of the \id{j}-th column of \id{Jac}, and if we assign this address
  to \id{realtype *col\_j}, then the \id{i}-th element of the
  \id{j}-th column is given by
  \id{SM\_COLUMN\_ELEMENT\_B(col\_j, i, j)}, counting from $0$.  Thus,
  for $(m,n)$ within the band, $J_{m,n}$ can be loaded by setting
  \id{col\_n = SM\_COLUMN\_B(J, n-1);} and
  \id{SM\_COLUMN\_ELEMENT\_B(col\_n, m-1, n-1) =} $J_{m,n}$.  The
  elements of the \id{j}-th column can also be accessed via ordinary
  array indexing, but this approach requires knowledge of the
  underlying storage for a band matrix of type {\sunmatband}.
  The array \id{col\_n} can be indexed from $-$\id{mupper} to
  \id{mlower}. For large problems, it is more efficient to use
  \id{SM\_COLUMN\_B} and \id{SM\_COLUMN\_ELEMENT\_B} than to use the
  \id{SM\_ELEMENT\_B} macro.  As in the dense case, these macros all
  number rows and columns starting from $0$.  The {\sunmatband} type
  and accessor macros are documented in \S\ref{ss:sunmat_band}.

  {\bf sparse}:\\
  A user-supplied sparse Jacobian function must load the \id{Neq} $\times$ \id{Neq}
  compressed-sparse-column or compressed-sparse-row matrix \id{Jac}
  with an approximation to the Jacobian matrix $J(t,y,\dot{y})$
  at the point (\id{tt}, \id{yy}, \id{yp}).
  Storage for \id{Jac} already exists on entry to
  this function, although the user should ensure that sufficient space
  is allocated in \id{Jac} to hold the nonzero values to be set; if
  the existing space is insufficient the user may reallocate the data
  and index arrays as needed.  The amount of allocated space in a
  {\sunmatsparse} object may be accessed using the macro
  \Id{SM\_NNZ\_S} or the routine \Id{SUNSparseMatrix\_NNZ}.  The
  {\sunmatsparse} type and accessor macros are documented in
  \S\ref{ss:sunmat_sparse}.

  The previous function type \Id{IDADlsJacFn} is identical to
  \id{IDALsJacFn}, and may still be used for backward-compatibility.
  However, this will be deprecated in future releases, so we recommend
  that users transition to the new function type name soon.

    is the current value of the residual vector $F(t,y,\dot{y})$.
  \item[cj]
    is the scalar in the system Jacobian, proportional to the inverse of the
    step size ($\alpha$ in Eq. (\ref{e:DAE_Jacobian}) ).
  \item[user\_data]
    is a pointer to user data, the same as the \id{user\_data}
    parameter passed to the function \id{IDASetUserData}.
  \end{args}
}
{
  The value returned by the preconditioner setup function is a flag
  indicating whether it was successful.  This value should be $0$ if successful,
  positive for a recoverable error (in which case the step will be retried),
  negative for an unrecoverable error (in which case the integration is halted).
}
{
  The operations performed by this function might include forming a crude
  approximate Jacobian, and performing an LU factorization on the resulting
  approximation.

  Each call to the preconditioner setup function is preceded by a call to the
  \id{IDAResFn} user function with the same (\id{tt}, \id{yy}, \id{yp}) arguments.
  Thus the preconditioner setup function can use any auxiliary data that is
  computed and saved during the evaluation of the DAE residual.

  This function is not called in advance of every call to the preconditioner solve
  function, but rather is called only as often as needed to achieve convergence in
  the nonlinear solver.

  If the user's \id{IDALsPrecSetupFn} function uses difference quotient
  approximations, it may need to access quantities not in the call
  list. These include the current stepsize, the error weights, etc.
  To obtain these, the user will need to add a pointer to \id{ida\_mem}
  to \id{user\_data} and then use the \id{IDAGet*} functions described in
  \S\ref{sss:optout_main}. The unit roundoff can be accessed as
  \id{UNIT\_ROUNDOFF} defined in \id{sundials\_types.h}.

  The previous function type \Id{IDASpilsPrecSetupFn} is identical to
  \id{IDALsPrecSetupFn}, and may still be used for backward-compatibility.
  However, this will be deprecated in future releases, so we recommend
  that users transition to the new function type name soon.

\section{Integration of pure quadrature equations}\label{ss:purequads}
%%=================================================================+++
%%
{\idas} allows the DAE system to include {\em pure quadratures}.  In
this case, it is more efficient to treat the quadratures separately by
excluding them from the nonlinear solution stage.  To do this, begin
by excluding the quadrature variables from the vectors \id{yy} and
\id{yp} and the quadrature equations from within \id{res}.  Thus a
separate vector \id{yQ} of quadrature variables is to satisfy
$(d/dt)$\id{yQ} = $f_Q(t,y,\dot{y})$.  The following is an overview of the
sequence of calls in a user's main program in this situation. Steps
that are unchanged from the skeleton program presented in
\S\ref{ss:skeleton_sim} are grayed out.

\subsection{Quadrature initialization and deallocation functions}\label{ss:quad_init}

The function \id{IDAQuadInit} activates integration of quadrature equations
and allocates internal memory related to these calculations.
The form of the call to this function is as follows:
%%
\ucfunction{IDAQuadInit}
{
flag = IDAQuadInit(ida\_mem, rhsQ, yQ0);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDAQuadInit} provides required problem specifications,
  allocates internal memory, and initializes quadrature integration.
}
{
  \begin{args}[ida\_mem]
  \item[ida\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the {\idas} memory block returned by \id{IDACreate}.
  \item[rhsQ] (\Id{IDAQuadRhsFn})
    is the {\CC} function which computes $f_Q$, the right-hand side of the quadrature
    equations. This function has the form
    \id{fQ(t, yy, yp, rhsQ, user\_data)} (for full details see \S\ref{ss:user_fct_quad}).
  \item[yQ0] (\id{N\_Vector})
    is the initial value of $y_Q$.
  \end{args}
}
{
  The return value \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) will be one of the following:
  \begin{args}[IDA\_MEM\_FAIL]
  \item[\Id{IDA\_SUCCESS}]
    The call to \id{IDAQuadInit} was successful.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_MEM\_NULL}]
    The {\idas} memory was not initialized by a prior call to \id{IDACreate}.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_MEM\_FAIL}]
    A memory allocation request failed.
  \end{args}
}
{
  If an error occurred, \id{IDAQuadInit} also sends an error message to the
  error handler function.
}
%%
\index{memory requirements!IDAS@{\idas} solver}
In terms of the number of quadrature variables $N_q$ and maximum
method order \id{maxord}, the size of the real workspace is increased
as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Base value: \id{lenrw} $=$ \id{lenrw} $+$ (\id{maxord+5})$N_q$
\item If \id{IDAQuadSVtolerances} is called: \id{lenrw} $=$ \id{lenrw} $+ N_q$
\end{itemize}
and the size of the integer workspace is increased as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Base value: \id{leniw} $=$ \id{leniw} $+$ (\id{maxord+5})$N_q$
\item If \id{IDAQuadSVtolerances} is called: \id{leniw} $=$ \id{leniw} $+ N_q$
\end{itemize}

The function \id{IDAQuadReInit}, useful during the solution of a
sequence of problems of same size, reinitializes the quadrature-related
internal memory and must follow a call to \Id{IDAQuadInit} (and maybe
a call to \id{IDAReInit}).  The number \id{Nq} of quadratures is
assumed to be unchanged from the prior call to \id{IDAQuadInit}.  The
call to the \id{IDAQuadReInit} function has the following form:
%%
\ucfunction{IDAQuadReInit}
{
  flag = IDAQuadReInit(ida\_mem, yQ0);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDAQuadReInit} provides required problem specifications
  and reinitializes the quadrature integration.
}
{
  \begin{args}[ida\_mem]
  \item[ida\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the {\idas} memory block.
  \item[yQ0] (\id{N\_Vector})
    is the initial value of $y_Q$.
  \end{args}
}
{
  The return value \id{flag} (of type \id{int}) will be one of the following:
  \begin{args}[IDA\_MEM\_NULL]
  \item[\Id{IDA\_SUCCESS}]
    The call to \id{IDAReInit} was successful.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_MEM\_NULL}]
    The {\idas} memory was not initialized by a prior call to \id{IDACreate}.
  \item[\Id{IDA\_NO\_QUAD}]
    Memory space for the quadrature integration was not allocated by a prior
    call to \id{IDAQuadInit}.
  \end{args}
}
{
  If an error occurred, \id{IDAQuadReInit} also sends an error message to the
  error handler function.
}
%%
%%
\ucfunction{IDAQuadFree}
{
  IDAQuadFree(ida\_mem);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDAQuadFree} frees the memory allocated for quadrature integration.
}
{
  The argument is the pointer to the {\idas} memory block (of type \id{void *}).
}
{
  The function \id{IDAQuadFree} has no return value.
}
{
  In general, \id{IDAQuadFree} need not be called by the user as it is
  invoked automatically by \id{IDAFree}.
}

%%===================================================================================

\subsection{IDAS solver function}

Even if quadrature integration was enabled, the call to the main solver
function \id{IDASolve} is exactly the same as in \S\ref{sss:idasolve}. However, in
this case the return value \id{flag} can also be one of the following:
\begin{args}[IDA\_FIRST\_QRHSFUNC\_FAIL]
\item[\Id{IDA\_QRHS\_FAIL}]
  The quadrature right-hand side function failed in an unrecoverable manner.
\item[\Id{IDA\_FIRST\_QRHS\_ERR}]
  The quadrature right-hand side function failed at the first call.
\item[\Id{IDA\_REP\_QRHS\_ERR}]
  Convergence test failures occurred too many times due to repeated
  recoverable errors in the quadrature right-hand side function. This
  value will also be returned if the quadrature right-hand side function
  had repeated recoverable errors during the estimation of an initial step
  size (assuming the quadrature variables are included in the error tests).
  \end{args}

%%===================================================================================

\subsection{Quadrature extraction functions}\label{ss:quad_get}

If quadrature integration has been initialized by a call to \id{IDAQuadInit},
or reinitialized by a call to \id{IDAQuadReInit}, then {\idas} computes both a solution
and quadratures at time \id{t}. However, \id{IDASolve} will still return only the solution
$y$ in \id{y}. Solution quadratures can be obtained using the following function:
%%
%%
\ucfunction{IDAGetQuad}
{
  flag = IDAGetQuad(ida\_mem, \&tret, yQ);
}
{
  The function \ID{IDAGetQuad} returns the quadrature solution vector after a
  successful return from \id{IDASolve}.

  \item[ida\_mem] (\id{void *})
    pointer to the memory previously allocated by \id{IDAInit}.

    Quadrature integration was not initialized.
  \item[IDA\_BAD\_DKY]
    \id{yQ} is \id{NULL}.
  \end{args}
}
{}
%%
%%
\index{optional output!interpolated quadratures}
The function \Id{IDAGetQuadDky} computes the \id{k}-th derivatives of the interpolating
polynomials for the quadrature variables at time \id{t}.
This function is called by \id{IDAGetQuad} with \id{k = 0} and with the current
time at which \id{IDASolve} has returned, but may also be called
directly by the user.

    the vector containing the derivative. This vector must be allocated by the user.

\subsection{User-supplied function for quadrature integration}
\label{ss:user_fct_quad}

\index{right-hand side function!quadrature equations}
For integration of quadrature equations, the user must provide a function
that defines the right-hand side of the quadrature equations (in other words,
the integrand function of the integral that must be evaluated). This function
must be of type \Id{IDAQuadRhsFn} defined as follows:
\usfunction{IDAQuadRhsFn}
{
  typedef int (*IDAQuadRhsFn)(&realtype t, N\_Vector yy, N\_Vector yp,\\
                             &N\_Vector rhsQ, void *user\_data);
}
{
  This function computes the quadrature equation right-hand side for a given value
  of the independent variable $t$ and state vectors $y$ and $\dot{y}$.
}
{
  \begin{args}[user\_data]
  \item[t]
    is the current value of the independent variable.
  \item[yy]
    is the current value of the dependent variable vector, $y(t)$.
  \item[yp]
    is the current value of the dependent variable derivative vector, $\dot{y}(t)$.
  \item[rhsQ]
    is the output vector $f_Q(t,y,\dot{y})$.
  \item[user\_data]
    is the \Id{user\_data} pointer passed to \id{IDASetUserData}.
  \end{args}
}
{
  A \id{IDAQuadRhsFn} should return 0 if successful, a positive value if a recoverable
  error occurred (in which case {\idas} will attempt to correct), or a negative
  value if it failed unrecoverably (in which case the integration is halted and
  \Id{IDA\_QRHS\_FAIL} is returned).
}
{
  Allocation of memory for \id{rhsQ} is automatically handled within {\idas}.

  Both \id{y} and \id{rhsQ} are of type \id{N\_Vector},
  but they  typically have different internal representations. It is the user's
  responsibility to access the vector data consistently (including the use of the
  correct accessor macros from each {\nvector} implementation). For the sake of
  computational efficiency, the vector functions in the two {\nvector} implementations
  provided with {\idas} do not perform any consistency checks with respect to their
  \id{N\_Vector} arguments (see \S\ref{ss:nvec_ser} and \S\ref{ss:nvec_par}).

  There is one situation in which recovery is not possible even if \id{IDAQuadRhsFn}
  function returns a recoverable error flag.  This is when this occurs at the very
  first call to the \id{IDAQuadRhsFn} (in which case {\idas} returns
  \Id{IDA\_FIRST\_QRHS\_ERR}).

A principal reason for using a parallel DAE solver such as {\idas} lies
in the solution of partial differential equations (PDEs).  Moreover,
the use of a Krylov iterative method for the solution of many such
problems is motivated by the nature of the underlying linear system of
equations (\ref{e:DAE_Newtoncorr}) that must be solved at each time step.  The
linear algebraic system is large, sparse, and structured. However, if
a Krylov iterative method is to be effective in this setting, then a
nontrivial preconditioner needs to be used.  Otherwise, the rate of
convergence of the Krylov iterative method is usually unacceptably
slow.  Unfortunately, an effective preconditioner tends to be
problem-specific.

However, we have developed one type of preconditioner that treats a
rather broad class of PDE-based problems.  It has been successfully
used for several realistic, large-scale problems \cite{HiTa:98} and is
included in a software module within the {\idas} package. This module
works with the parallel vector module {\nvecp} and
generates a preconditioner that is a block-diagonal matrix with each
block being a band matrix. The blocks need not have the same number of
super- and sub-diagonals, and these numbers may vary from block to
block. This Band-Block-Diagonal Preconditioner module is called
{\idabbdpre}.

\index{IDABBDPRE@{\idabbdpre} preconditioner!description|(}
\index{preconditioning!band-block diagonal}
One way to envision these preconditioners is to think of the domain of
the computational PDE problem as being subdivided into $M$ non-overlapping
sub-domains.  Each of these sub-domains is then assigned to one of the
$M$ processors to be used to solve the DAE system. The basic idea is
to isolate the preconditioning so that it is local to each processor,
and also to use a (possibly cheaper) approximate residual
function. This requires the definition of a new function $G(t,y,\dot{y})$
which approximates the function $F(t, y, \dot{y})$ in the definition of the DAE
system (\ref{e:DAE}). However, the user may set $G = F$.  Corresponding
to the domain decomposition, there is a decomposition of the solution
vectors $y$ and $\dot{y}$ into $M$ disjoint blocks $y_m$ and $\dot{y}_m$, and a
decomposition of $G$ into blocks $G_m$.  The block $G_m$ depends on $y_m$
and $\dot{y}_m$, and also on components of $y_{m'}$ and $\dot{y}_{m'}$ associated with
neighboring sub-domains (so-called ghost-cell data).  Let $\bar{y}_m$
and $\bar{\dot{y}}_m$ denote $y_m$ and $\dot{y}_m$ (respectively) augmented
with those other components on which $G_m$ depends.  Then we have
\begin{equation}
  G(t,y,\dot{y}) = [G_1(t,\bar{y}_1,\bar{\dot{y}}_1), G_2(t,\bar{y}_2,\bar{\dot{y}}_2),
               \ldots, G_M(t,\bar{y}_M,\bar{\dot{y}}_M)]^T ~,
\end{equation}
and each of the blocks $G_m(t,\bar{y}_m,\bar{\dot{y}}_m)$ is uncoupled from
the others.

The preconditioner associated with this decomposition has the form
\begin{equation}
  P= diag[P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_M]
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  P_m \approx \partial G_m / \partial y_m
  + \alpha \partial G_m / \partial \dot{y}_m
\end{equation}
This matrix is taken to be banded, with
upper and lower half-bandwidths \id{mudq} and \id{mldq} defined as
the number of non-zero diagonals above and below the main diagonal,
respectively. The difference quotient approximation is computed using
\id{mudq} $+$ \id{mldq} $+ 2$ evaluations of $G_m$, but only a matrix
of bandwidth \id{mukeep} $+$ \id{mlkeep} $+ 1$ is retained.

Neither pair of parameters need be the true half-bandwidths of the Jacobians
of the local block of $G$, if smaller values provide a more efficient
preconditioner.  Such an efficiency gain may occur if the couplings
in the DAE system outside a certain bandwidth are considerably weaker than
those within the band.  Reducing \id{mukeep} and \id{mlkeep} while keeping
\id{mudq} and \id{mldq} at their true values, discards the elements
outside the narrower band.  Reducing both pairs has the additional
effect of lumping the outer Jacobian elements into the computed elements
within the band, and requires more caution and experimentation.

The solution of the complete linear system
\begin{equation}
  Px = b
\end{equation}
reduces to solving each of the equations
\begin{equation}
  P_m x_m = b_m
\end{equation}
and this is done by banded LU factorization of $P_m$ followed by a banded
backsolve.
\index{IDABBDPRE@{\idabbdpre} preconditioner!description|)}

Similar block-diagonal preconditioners could be considered with different
treatment of the blocks $P_m$. For example, incomplete LU factorization or
an iterative method could be used instead of banded LU factorization.

The {\idabbdpre} module calls two user-provided functions to construct $P$:
a required function \id{Gres} (of type \id{IDABBDLocalFn}) which approximates
the residual function $G(t,y,\dot{y}) \approx F(t,y,\dot{y})$ and which is computed locally,
and an optional function \id{Gcomm} (of type \id{IDABBDCommFn}) which performs
all inter-process communication necessary to evaluate the approximate residual $G$.
These are in addition to the user-supplied residual function \id{res}.
Both functions take as input the same pointer \id{user\_data} as passed
by the user to \id{IDASetUserData} and passed to the user's function \id{res}.
The user is responsible for providing space (presumably within
\id{user\_data}) for components of \id{yy} and \id{yp} that are
communicated by \id{Gcomm} from the other processors, and that are
then used by \id{Gres}, which should not do any communication.
%%
%%
\usfunction{IDABBDLocalFn}
{
  typedef int (*IDABBDLocalFn)(&sunindextype Nlocal, realtype tt,  \\
                                &N\_Vector yy, N\_Vector yp, N\_Vector gval, \\
                                &void *user\_data);
}
{
  This \id{Gres} function computes $G(t,y,\dot{y})$. It loads the vector
  \id{gval} as a function of \id{tt}, \id{yy}, and \id{yp}.
}
{
  \begin{args}[user\_data]
  \item[Nlocal]
    is the local vector length.
  \item[tt]
    is the value of the independent variable.
  \item[yy]
    is the dependent variable.
  \item[yp]
    is the derivative of the dependent variable.
  \item[gval]
    is the output vector.
  \item[user\_data]
    is a pointer to user data, the same as the \Id{user\_data}
    parameter passed to \id{IDASetUserData}.
  \end{args}
}
{
  An \id{IDABBDLocalFn} function type should return 0 to indicate success,
  1 for a recoverable error, or -1 for a non-recoverable error.
}
{
  This function must assume that all inter-processor communication of data needed to
  calculate \id{gval} has already been done, and this data is accessible within
  \id{user\_data}.

  The case where $G$ is mathematically identical to $F$ is allowed.
}
%%
%%
\usfunction{IDABBDCommFn}
{
  typedef int (*IDABBDCommFn)(&sunindextype Nlocal, realtype tt,  \\
                               &N\_Vector yy, N\_Vector yp, void *user\_data);
}
{
  This \id{Gcomm} function performs all inter-processor communications necessary
  for the execution of the \id{Gres} function above, using the input
  vectors \id{yy} and \id{yp}.
}
{
  \begin{args}[user\_data]
  \item[Nlocal]
    is the local vector length.
  \item[tt]
    is the value of the independent variable.
  \item[yy]
    is the dependent variable.
  \item[yp]
    is the derivative of the dependent variable.
  \item[user\_data]
    is a pointer to user data, the same as the \Id{user\_data}
    parameter passed to \id{IDASetUserData}.
  \end{args}
}
{
  An \id{IDABBDCommFn} function type should return 0 to indicate success,
  1 for a recoverable error, or -1 for a non-recoverable error.
}
{
  The \id{Gcomm} function is expected to save communicated data in space defined
  within the structure \id{user\_data}.

  Each call to the \id{Gcomm} function is preceded by a call to the residual
  function \id{res} with the same (\id{tt}, \id{yy}, \id{yp}) arguments.
  Thus \id{Gcomm} can omit any communications done by \id{res} if relevant to the
  evaluation of \id{Gres}.
  If all necessary communication was done in \id{res}, then \id{Gcomm} $=$ \id{NULL}
  can be passed in the call to \id{IDABBDPrecInit} (see below).

Besides the header files required for the integration of the DAE problem
(see \S\ref{ss:header_sim}),  to use the {\idabbdpre} module, the main program

function prototypes.\index{header files}

The {\idabbdpre} module also provides a reinitialization function to allow
for a sequence of problems of the same size, with the same linear solver choice,
provided there is no
change in \id{local\_N}, \id{mukeep}, or \id{mlkeep}.
After solving one problem, and after calling \id{IDAReInit} to re-initialize
{\idas} for a subsequent problem, a call to \id{IDABBDPrecReInit} can be made

used in the difference-quotient Jacobian approximations, the relative increment
\id{dq\_rel\_yy}, or one of the user-supplied functions \id{Gres} and \id{Gcomm}.
If there is a change in any of the linear solver inputs, an additional call
to the ``Set'' routines provided by the {\sunlinsol} module, and/or
