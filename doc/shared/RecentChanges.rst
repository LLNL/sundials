**New Features**

**Bug Fixes**

Updated the CMake variable ``HIP_PLATFORM`` default to ``amd`` as the previous
default, ``hcc``, is no longer recognized in ROCm 5.7.0 or newer. The new
default is also valid in older version of ROCm (at least back to version 4.3.1).

Fixed a bug in the HIP execution policies where ``WARP_SIZE`` would not be set
with ROCm 6.0.0 or newer.
