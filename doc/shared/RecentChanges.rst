**Major Features**

Replaced the ARKODE ``MRIStepInnerStepper`` interface with :c:type:`SUNStepper`.
:c:func:`MRIStepCreate` now accepts a :c:type:`SUNStepper`, which can created by
:c:func:`ARKodeCreateSUNStepper` or manually. :c:func:`SUNStepper_Evolve` and
:c:type:`SUNStepperEvolveFn` now return an integer status where zero is success,
positive values are recoverable failures, and negative values are fatal
failures. Added accumulated error get/reset and relative tolerance operations
to `SUNStepper` to support `SUNAdaptController_MRIHTol`.
