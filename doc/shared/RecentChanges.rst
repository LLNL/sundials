**Major Features**

**New Features and Enhancements**

The default value of :cmakeop:`CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` is no longer set to
``70`` and is now determined automatically by CMake. Users are encouraged to
override the default value as it varies across compilers and compiler versions.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed the loading of ARKStep's default first order explicit method.

Fixed a CMake bug regarding usage of missing "print_warning" macro
that was only triggered when the deprecated ``CUDA_ARCH`` option was used.
