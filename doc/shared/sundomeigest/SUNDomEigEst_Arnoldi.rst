.. _SUNDomEigEst.Arnoldi:

The SUNDomEigEstimator_Arnoldi Module
=====================================

.. versionadded:: 7.5.0

The SUNDomEigEstimator_Arnoldi implementation of the
:c:type:`SUNDomEigEstimator` class performs the Arnoldi Iteration method
:cite:p:`arnoldi51`; this is an iterative dominant eigenvalue estimator that is
designed to be compatible with any ``N_Vector`` implementation that supports a
minimal subset of operations (:c:func:`N_VClone()`, :c:func:`N_VDotProd()`,
:c:func:`N_VScale()`, and :c:func:`N_VDestroy()`).

Arnoldi iteration is particularly effective for large, sparse matrices where only
the dominant eigenvalue is needed.  It constructs an orthonormal basis of the Krylov
subspace

.. math::

   \mathcal{K}_m(A, \mathbf{v}) = \text{span}\{\mathbf{v}, A \mathbf{v}, A^2 \mathbf{v}, \dots, A^{m-1} \mathbf{v}\}

using the Gram-Schmidt process.  The matrix :math:`A` is projected onto this subspace
to form a small upper Hessenberg matrix :math:`H_m`.  The eigenvalues of :math:`H_m`
approximate some of the eigenvalues of :math:`A`; the dominant eigenvalue of :math:`A` is
well-approximated by the dominant eigenvalue of :math:`H_m`.

Arnoldi iteration works for matrices with both real and complex eigenvalues.  It supports
estimations with a user-specified fixed Krylov subspace dimension (at least 3).  This
choice guarantees a bounded memory footprint, which is essential for large-scale
problems, while strongly influencing the quality of the estimate.  To improve the
estimation accuracy, we have found that preprocessing with a number of power
iterations is particularly useful.  This operation requires no additional Krylov
storage and is further explained below.

Unlike the power iteration, these implementations do not perform tolerance-based
convergence checks at every Arnoldi step, since repeating an Arnoldi iteration due
to failed convergence would be computationally expensive.  Instead, the
magnitude-based convergence criterion defined in :ref:`relative tolerance <pi_rel_tol>`
is used as a preliminary screening mechanism before invoking the Krylov-based estimator.

While this approach is slightly less robust than explicitly monitoring both the
real and imaginary components of the eigenvalue residual during Arnoldi iteration,
it significantly reduces computational cost.  This trade-off is particularly
advantageous for large-scale problems, where each Arnoldi cycle may be expensive.

The matrix :math:`A` is not required explicitly; only a routine that provides an
approximation of the matrix-vector product, :math:`Av`, is required.


.. _SUNDomEigEst.Arnoldi.Usage:

SUNDomEigEstimator_Arnoldi Usage
--------------------------------

To use SUNDomEigEstimator_Arnoldi include the header file
``sundomeigest/sundomeigest_arnoldi.h``, and link to the library
``libsundials_sundomeigestarnoldi``.

The module SUNDomEigEstimator_Arnoldi provides the following user-callable
routines:


.. c:function:: SUNDomEigEstimator SUNDomEigEstimator_Arnoldi(N_Vector q, int kry_dim, SUNContext sunctx);

   This constructor function creates and allocates memory for the Arnoldi
   iteration implementation of a :c:type:`SUNDomEigEstimator`.

   Consistency checks are performed to ensure the input vector is non-zero and
   supplies the necessary operations.

   :param q: the initial guess for the dominant eigenvector; this should not be
             a non-dominant eigenvector of the Jacobian.
   :param kry_dim: the dimension of the Krylov subspace (default 3). A value
                   :math:`\leq 2` will result in using default value. This
                   default is chosen to minimize the memory footprint.
   :param sunctx: the :c:type:`SUNContext` object.

   :returns: If successful, a :c:type:`SUNDomEigEstimator` otherwise ``NULL``.

   .. note::

      When used in a time-dependent context, the initial guess supplied to the
      constructor, ``q``, is used only in the first
      :c:func:`SUNDomEigEstimator_Estimate` call and is overwritten with the
      result of the most recent preprocessing iterations (see
      :c:func:`SUNDomEigEstimator_SetNumPreprocessIters`). As an initial guess
      too close to the dominant eigenvector may cause a breakdown in the
      Gram–Schmidt process within the Arnoldi iteration, users should account
      for this when setting the number of initial and subsequent preprocessing
      iterations (e.g., with LSRKStep see
      :c:func:`LSRKStepSetNumDomEigEstInitPreprocessIters` and
      :c:func:`LSRKStepSetNumDomEigEstPreprocessIters`).

      The initial guess can be reset with
      :c:func:`SUNDomEigEstimator_SetInitialGuess`.


.. c:function:: SUNErrCode SUNDomEigEstimator_SetRelTol_Arnoldi(SUNDomEigEstimator DEE, sunrealtype rel_tol)

   This routine sets the relative tolerance used during the preprocessing phase
   of the Arnoldi implementation.

   :param DEE: the dominant eigenvalue estimator object.
   :param rel_tol: requested relative tolerance.

   :returns: ``SUN_SUCCESS`` if successful, otherwise an appropriate error code.

   .. note::

      In the Arnoldi implementation, ``rel_tol`` is used only to assess the
      preprocessing Power iterations. Once the preprocessing estimate satisfies

      .. math::

         \left|\lambda_{k} - \lambda_{k-1}\right|
         \le \mathtt{rel\_tol} \cdot |\lambda_{k}|,

      the Arnoldi iteration begins. This avoids restarting Arnoldi repeatedly.

      Supplying ``rel_tol < 0`` disables preprocessing-to-tolerance behavior.
      Inputs satisfying :math:`0 < \mathtt{rel\_tol} < 1`
      enable this behavior and are used directly. Values with
      :math:`\mathtt{rel\_tol} = 0` or
      :math:`\mathtt{rel\_tol} >= 1` reset to the default value
      ``0.005``.


.. _SUNDomEigEst.Arnoldi.Description:

SUNDomEigEstimator_Arnoldi Description
--------------------------------------

The SUNDomEigEstimator_Arnoldi module defines the *content* field of a
``SUNDomEigEstimator`` to be the following structure:

.. code-block:: c

   struct SUNDomEigEstimatorContent_Arnoldi_ {
     SUNATimesFn ATimes;
     void* ATdata;
     N_Vector* V;
     N_Vector q;
     N_Vector rhs_linY;
     N_Vector Fy;
     N_Vector work;
     int kry_dim;
     int num_warmups;
     long int num_iters;
     sunbooleantype warmup_to_tol;
     sunrealtype tol_warmup;
     sunrealtype rhs_linT;
     long int num_ATimes;
     SUNRhsFn rhsfn;
     void* rhs_data;
     long int nfevals;
     sunrealtype* LAPACK_A;
     sunrealtype* LAPACK_wr;
     sunrealtype* LAPACK_wi;
     sunrealtype* LAPACK_work;
     sunindextype LAPACK_lwork;
     sunrealtype** LAPACK_arr;
     sunrealtype** Hes;
   };


These entries of the *content* field contain the following
information:

* ``ATimes`` - function pointer to perform the product :math:`Av`,

* ``ATdata`` - pointer to structure for ``ATimes``,

* ``V, q, Fy, work``   - vectors used for workspace.

* ``kry_dim`` - dimension of Krylov subspaces (default is 3),

* ``num_warmups`` - number of preprocessing iterations (default is 100),

* ``num_iters`` - number of iterations (preprocessing and estimation) in the
  last :c:func:`SUNDomEigEstimator_Estimate` call,

* ``warmup_to_tol`` - enable warmup iterations (default is ``SUNFALSE``)

* ``tol_warmup`` - tolerance for preprocessing iterations (default is 0.005;
  only used if ``warmup_to_tol`` is ``SUNTRUE``),

* ``rhs_linY`` - state vector for linearization point,

* ``rhs_linT`` - time value for linearization point,

* ``rhsfn`` - user provided RHS function,

* ``rhs_data`` - pointer to the data structure for ``rhsfn``,

* ``nfevals`` - number of RHS evaluations,

* ``num_ATimes`` - number of calls to the ``ATimes`` function,

* ``LAPACK_A, LAPACK_wr, LAPACK_wi, LAPACK_work`` - ``sunrealtype`` used for workspace by LAPACK,

* ``LAPACK_lwork`` - the size of the ``LAPACK_work`` requested by LAPACK,

* ``LAPACK_arr`` - storage for the estimated dominant eigenvalues,

* ``Hes`` - Hessenberg matrix,


This estimator is constructed to perform the following operations:

* During construction all ``N_Vector`` estimator data is allocated, with
  vectors cloned from a template ``N_Vector`` that is input, and
  default generic estimator parameters are set.

* User-facing "set" routines may be called to modify default
  estimator parameters.

* SUNDIALS packages will call :c:func:`SUNDomEigEstimator_SetATimes` to supply
  the ``ATimes`` function pointer and the related data ``ATdata``. Or, the user
  may call :c:func:`SUNDomEigEstimator_SetRhs` to supply the RHS function and
  related data. This approach internally constructs an ``ATimes`` function that
  uses the RHS function to compute the matrix-vector product :math:`Av` for
  the Jacobian of the RHS function.

* In :c:func:`SUNDomEigEstimator_Initialize`, the estimator parameters are
  checked for validity and the remaining Arnoldi estimator memory such as LAPACK
  workspace is allocated.

* In :c:func:`SUNDomEigEstimator_Estimate`, the initial nonzero vector
  :math:`q_0` is preprocessed with some fixed number of Power iterations,

  .. math::

     q_1 = \frac{Aq_0}{||Aq_0||} \quad \cdots \quad q_k = \frac{Aq_{k-1}}{||Aq_{k-1}||},

  (see :c:func:`LSRKStepSetNumDomEigEstInitPreprocessIters` and
  :c:func:`LSRKStepSetNumDomEigEstPreprocessIters` for setting the number of
  preprocessing iterations). If tolerance-based warmup checking is enabled via
  :c:func:`SUNDomEigEstimator_SetRelTol_Arnoldi`, this preprocessing phase may
  terminate early once the warmup estimate satisfies the requested relative
  tolerance. Then, the Arnoldi iteration is performed to compute the estimate.

The SUNDomEigEstimator_Arnoldi module defines implementations of all dominant
eigenvalue estimator operations listed in :numref:`SUNDomEigEst.API`:

* ``SUNDomEigEstimator_SetATimes_Arnoldi``

*  ``SUNDomEigEstimator_SetRhs_Arnoldi``

* ``SUNDomEigEstimator_SetRhsLinearizationPoint_Arnoldi``
