Changes to SUNDIALS in release 7.0.0
====================================

**Major Feature**

SUNDIALS now has more robust and uniform error handling. Non-release builds will
be built with additional error checking by default. See
:numref:`SUNDIALS.Errors` for details.

**Breaking Changes**

*Minimum C Standard*

SUNDIALS now requires using a compiler that supports a subset of the C99
standard. Note with the Microsoft C/C++ compiler the subset of C99 features
utilized by SUNDIALS are available starting with `Visual Studio 2015
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/overview/visual-cpp-language-conformance?view=msvc-170#c-standard-library-features-1>`_.

*Minimum CMake Version*

CMake 3.18 or newer is now required when building SUNDIALS.

*Deprecated Types and Functions Removed*

The previously deprecated types ``realtype`` and ``booleantype`` were removed
from ``sundials_types.h`` and replaced with :c:type:`sunrealtype` and
:c:type:`sunbooleantype`. The deprecated names for these types can be used by
including the header file ``sundials_types_deprecated.h`` but will be fully
removed in the next major release. Functions, types and header files that were
previously deprecated have also been removed.

*Error Handling Changes*

With the addition of the new error handling capability, the ``*SetErrHandlerFn``
and ``*SetErrFile`` functions in CVODE(S), IDA(S), ARKODE, and KINSOL have been
removed. Users of these functions can use the functions
:c:func:`SUNContext_PushErrHandler`, and :c:func:`SUNLogger_SetErrorFilename`
instead. For further details see Sections :numref:`SUNDIALS.Errors` and
:numref:`SUNDIALS.Logging`.

In addition the following names/symbols were replaced by ``SUN_ERR_*`` codes:

+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Removed                          | Replaced with ``SUNErrCode``      |
+==================================+===================================+

+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| ``SUNMAT_SUCCESS``               | ``SUN_SUCCESS``                   |
+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| ``SUNMAT_MATVEC_SETUP_REQUIRED`` | ``SUN_ERR_OP_FAIL``               |
+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

The following functions have had their signature updated to ensure they can
leverage the new SUNDIALS error handling capabilities.

* From ``sundials_futils.h``

  * :c:func:`SUNDIALSFileOpen`
  * :c:func:`SUNDIALSFileClose`

* From ``sundials_memory.h``

  * :c:func:`SUNMemoryNewEmpty`
  * :c:func:`SUNMemoryHelper_Alias`
  * :c:func:`SUNMemoryHelper_Wrap`

* From ``sundials_nvector.h``

  * :c:func:`N_VNewVectorArray`

*SUNComm Type Added*

We have replaced the use of a type-erased (i.e., ``void*``) pointer to a
communicator in place of ``MPI_Comm`` throughout the SUNDIALS API with a
:c:type:`SUNComm`, which is just a typedef to an ``int`` in builds without MPI
and a typedef to a ``MPI_Comm`` in builds with MPI. As a result:

- When MPI is enabled, all SUNDIALS libraries will include MPI symbols and
  applications will need to include the path for MPI headers and link against
  the corresponding MPI library.

- All users will need to update their codes because the call to
  :c:func:`SUNContext_Create` now takes a :c:type:`SUNComm` instead
  of type-erased pointer to a communicator. For non-MPI codes,
  pass :c:macro:`SUN_COMM_NULL` to the ``comm`` argument instead of
  ``NULL``. For MPI codes, pass the ``MPI_Comm`` directly.

- The same change must be made for calls to
  :c:func:`SUNLogger_Create` or :c:func:`SUNProfiler_Create`.

- Some users will need to update their calls to :c:func:`N_VGetCommunicator`,
  and update any custom :c:type:`N_Vector` implementations that provide
  :c:func:`N_VGetCommunicator`, since it now returns a :c:type:`SUNComm`.

The change away from type-erased pointers for :c:type:`SUNComm` fixes problems
like the one described in
`GitHub Issue #275 <https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/issues/275>`_.

The SUNLogger is now always MPI-aware if MPI is enabled in SUNDIALS and the
``SUNDIALS_LOGGING_ENABLE_MPI`` CMake option and macro definition were removed
accordingly.

*SUNDIALS Core Library*

Users now need to link to ``sundials_core`` in addition to the libraries already
linked to. This will be picked up automatically in projects that use the
SUNDIALS CMake target. The library ``sundials_generic`` has been superseded by
``sundials_core`` and is no longer available. This fixes some duplicate symbol
errors on Windows when linking to multiple SUNDIALS libraries.

*Fortran Interface Modules Streamlined*

We have streamlined the Fortran modules that need to be included by users by
combining the SUNDIALS core into one Fortran module,
``fsundials_core_mod``. Modules for implementations of the core APIs still exist
(e.g., for the Dense linear solver there is ``fsunlinsol_dense_mod``) as do the
modules for the SUNDIALS packages (e.g., ``fcvode_mod``).  The following modules
are the ones that have been consolidated into ``fsundials_core_mod``:

.. code-block:: fortran

   fsundials_adaptcontroller_mod
   fsundials_context_mod
   fsundials_futils_mod
   fsundials_linearsolver_mod
   fsundials_logger_mod
   fsundials_matrix_mod
   fsundials_nonlinearsolver_mod
   fsundials_nvector_mod
   fsundials_profiler_mod
   fsundials_types_mod

**Minor Changes**

The ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` defaults to ``RelWithDebInfo`` mode now i.e., SUNDIALS
will be built with optimizations and debugging symbols enabled by default.
Previously the build type was unset by default so no optimization or debugging
flags were set.

The advanced CMake options to override the inferred LAPACK name-mangling scheme
have been updated from ``SUNDIALS_F77_FUNC_CASE`` and
``SUNDIALS_F77_FUNC_UNDERSCORES`` to :cmakeop:`SUNDIALS_LAPACK_CASE` and
:cmakeop:`SUNDIALS_LAPACK_UNDERSCORES`, respectively.

As a subset of C99 is now required the CMake option ``USE_GENERIC_MATH`` as been
removed.

The C++ convenience classes (e.g., ``sundials::Context``) have been moved to
from SUNDIALS ``.h`` headers to corresponding ``.hpp`` headers (e.g.,
``sundials/sundials_context.hpp``) so C++ codes do not need to compile with
C++14 support when using the C API.

Converted most previous Fortran 77 and 90 examples to use SUNDIALS' Fortran 2003
interface.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed `GitHub Issue #329 <https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/issues/329>`_ so
that C++20 aggregate initialization can be used.

Fixed integer overflow in the internal SUNDIALS hashmap. This resolves
`GitHub Issues #409 <https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/issues/409>`_ and
`#249 <https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/issues/249>`_.

**Deprecation Notice**

The functions in ``sundials_math.h`` will be deprecated in the next release.

.. code-block:: c

   sunrealtype SUNRpowerI(sunrealtype base, int exponent);
   sunrealtype SUNRpowerR(sunrealtype base, sunrealtype exponent);
   sunbooleantype SUNRCompare(sunrealtype a, sunrealtype b);
   sunbooleantype SUNRCompareTol(sunrealtype a, sunrealtype b, sunrealtype tol);
   sunrealtype SUNStrToReal(const char* str);

Additionally, the following header files (and everything in them) will be deprecated -- users who
rely on these are recommended to transition to the corresponding :c:type:`SUNMatrix` and
:c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` modules:

.. code-block:: c

   sundials_direct.h
   sundials_dense.h
   sundials_band.h

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 6.7.0
====================================

**Major Feature**

Added the :c:type:`SUNAdaptController` base class, ported ARKODE's internal
implementations of time step controllers to implementations of this class, and
updated ARKODE to use these objects instead of its own implementations. Added
:c:func:`ARKStepSetAdaptController` and :c:func:`ERKStepSetAdaptController`
routines so that users can modify controller parameters, or even provide custom
implementations.

**New Features**

Improved the computational complexity of the sparse matrix ``ScaleAddI``
function from :math:`\mathcal{O}(M * N)` to :math:`\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{NNZ})`.

Added Fortran support for the LAPACK dense linear solver implementation.

Added the routines :c:func:`ARKStepSetAdaptivityAdjustment` and
:c:func:`ERKStepSetAdaptivityAdjustment`, that allow users to adjust the
value for the method order supplied to the temporal adaptivity controllers.
The ARKODE default for this adjustment has been :math:`-1` since its initial
release, but for some applications a value of :math:`0` is more appropriate.
Users who notice that their simulations encounter a large number of
temporal error test failures may want to experiment with adjusting this value.

Added the third order ERK method ``ARKODE_SHU_OSHER_3_2_3``, the fourth order
ERK method ``ARKODE_SOFRONIOU_SPALETTA_5_3_4``, the sixth order ERK method
``ARKODE_VERNER_9_5_6``, the seventh order ERK method ``ARKODE_VERNER_10_6_7``,
the eighth order ERK method ``ARKODE_VERNER_13_7_8``, and the ninth order ERK
method ``ARKODE_VERNER_16_8_9``.

ARKStep, ERKStep, MRIStep, and SPRKStep were updated to remove a potentially
unnecessary right-hand side evaluation at the end of an integration. ARKStep was
additionally updated to remove extra right-hand side evaluations when using an
explicit method or an implicit method with an explicit first stage.

The :c:type:`MRIStepInnerStepper` class in MRIStep was updated to make supplying
an :c:type:`MRIStepInnerFullRhsFn` optional.

**Bug Fixes**

Changed the :c:type:`SUNProfiler` so that it does not rely on ``MPI_WTime`` in
any case. This fixes `GitHub Issue #312 <https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/issues/312>`_.

Fixed scaling bug in ``SUNMatScaleAddI_Sparse`` for non-square matrices.

Fixed a regression introduced by the stop time bug fix in v6.6.1 where ARKODE,
CVODE, CVODES, IDA, and IDAS would return at the stop time rather than the
requested output time if the stop time was reached in the same step in which the
output time was passed.

Fixed a bug in ERKStep where methods with :math:`c_s = 1` but
:math:`a_{s,j} \neq b_j` were incorrectly treated as having the first same as
last (FSAL) property.

Fixed a bug in ARKODE where :c:func:`ARKStepSetInterpolateStopTime` would return
an interpolated solution at the stop time in some cases when interpolation was
disabled.

Fixed a bug in :c:func:`ARKStepSetTableNum` wherein it did not recognize
``ARKODE_ARK2_ERK_3_1_2`` and ``ARKODE_ARK2_DIRK_3_1_2`` as a valid additive
Runge--Kutta Butcher table pair.

Fixed a bug in :c:func:`MRIStepCoupling_Write` where explicit coupling tables
were not written to the output file pointer.

Fixed missing soversions in some :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` and
:c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` CMake targets.

Renamed some internal types in CVODES and IDAS to allow both packages to be
built together in the same binary.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 6.6.2
====================================

Fixed the build system support for MAGMA when using a NVIDIA HPC SDK
installation of CUDA and fixed the targets used for rocBLAS and rocSPARSE.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 6.6.1
====================================

**New Features**

Updated the Trilinos Tpetra :c:type:`N_Vector` interface to support Trilinos 14.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed a memory leak when destroying a CUDA, HIP, SYCL, or system
:c:type:`SUNMemoryHelper` object.

Fixed a bug in ARKODE, CVODE, CVODES, IDA, and IDAS where the stop time may not
be cleared when using normal mode if the requested output time is the same as
the stop time. Additionally, with ARKODE, CVODE, and CVODES this fix removes an
unnecessary interpolation of the solution at the stop time that could occur in
this case.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 6.6.0
====================================

**Major Features**

A new time-stepping module, :ref:`SPRKStep <ARKODE.Mathematics.SPRKStep>`, was
added to ARKODE. This time-stepper provides explicit symplectic partitioned
Runge-Kutta methods up to order 10 for separable Hamiltonian systems.

Added support for relaxation Runge-Kutta methods in ERKStep and ARKStep, see
:ref:`ARKODE.Mathematics.Relaxation`, :ref:`ARKODE.Usage.ERKStep.Relaxation`,
and :ref:`ARKODE.Usage.ARKStep.Relaxation` for more information.

**New Features**

Updated the default ARKODE, CVODE, and CVODES behavior when returning the
solution when the internal time has reached a user-specified stop time.
Previously, the output solution was interpolated to the value of ``tstop``; the
default is now to copy the internal solution vector. Users who wish to revert to
interpolation may call a new routine :c:func:`CVodeSetInterpolateStopTime`,
:c:func:`ARKStepSetInterpolateStopTime`, :c:func:`ERKStepSetInterpolateStopTime`,
or :c:func:`MRIStepSetInterpolateStopTime`.

Added the second order IMEX method from :cite:p:`giraldo2013implicit` as the
default second order IMEX method in ARKStep. The explicit table is given by
``ARKODE_ARK2_ERK_3_1_2`` (see :ref:`Butcher.ARK2_ERK`) and the implicit
table by ``ARKODE_ARK2_DIRK_3_1_2`` (see :ref:`Butcher.ARK2_DIRK`).

Updated the F2003 utility routines :c:func:`SUNDIALSFileOpen` and
:c:func:`SUNDIALSFileClose` to support user specification of ``stdout`` and
``stderr`` strings for the output file names.

**Bug Fixes**

A potential bug was fixed when using inequality constraint handling and
calling :c:func:`ARKStepGetEstLocalErrors` or :c:func:`ERKStepGetEstLocalErrors`
after a failed step in which an inequality constraint violation occurred. In
this case, the values returned by :c:func:`ARKStepGetEstLocalErrors` or
:c:func:`ERKStepGetEstLocalErrors` may have been invalid.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 6.5.1
====================================

**New Features**

Added the following functions to disable a previously set stop time:

* :c:func:`ARKStepClearStopTime`
* :c:func:`ERKStepClearStopTime`
* :c:func:`MRIStepClearStopTime`
* :c:func:`CVodeClearStopTime`
* :c:func:`IDAClearStopTime`

The default interpolant in ARKODE when using a first order method has been
updated to a linear interpolant to ensure values obtained by the integrator are
returned at the ends of the time interval. To restore the previous behavior of
using a constant interpolant call :c:func:`ARKStepSetInterpolantDegree`,
:c:func:`ERKStepSetInterpolantDegree`, or :c:func:`MRIStepSetInterpolantDegree`
and set the interpolant degree to zero before evolving the problem.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed build errors when using SuperLU_DIST with ROCM enabled to target AMD GPUs.

Fixed compilation errors in some SYCL examples when using the ``icx`` compiler.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 6.5.0
====================================

**New Features**

A new capability to keep track of memory allocations made through the
:c:type:`SUNMemoryHelper` classes has been added. Memory allocation stats can be
accessed through the :c:func:`SUNMemoryHelper_GetAllocStats` function. See
:numref:`SUNMemory.Description` for more details.

Added the following functions to assist in debugging simulations utilizing
matrix-based linear solvers:

* :c:func:`ARKStepGetJac`
* :c:func:`ARKStepGetJacTime`
* :c:func:`ARKStepGetJacNumSteps`
* :c:func:`MRIStepGetJac`
* :c:func:`MRIStepGetJacTime`
* :c:func:`MRIStepGetJacNumSteps`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetJac`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetJacTime`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetJacNumSteps`
* :c:func:`IDAGetJac`
* :c:func:`IDAGetJacCj`
* :c:func:`IDAGetJacTime`
* :c:func:`IDAGetJacNumSteps`
* :c:func:`KINGetJac`
* :c:func:`KINGetJacNumIters`

Added support for CUDA 12.

Added support for the SYCL backend with RAJA 2022.x.y.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed an underflow bug during root finding in ARKODE, CVODE, CVODES, IDA and
IDAS. This fixes `GitHub Issue #57 <https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/issues/57>`_.

Fixed an issue with finding oneMKL when using the ``icpx`` compiler with the
``-fsycl`` flag as the C++ compiler instead of ``dpcpp``.

Fixed the shape of the arrays returned by the Fortran interfaces to
:c:func:`N_VGetArrayPointer`, :c:func:`SUNDenseMatrix_Data`,
:c:func:`SUNBandMatrix_Data`, :c:func:`SUNSparseMatrix_Data`,
:c:func:`SUNSparseMatrix_IndexValues`, and
:c:func:`SUNSparseMatrix_IndexPointers`. Compiling and running code that uses
the SUNDIALS Fortran interfaces with bounds checking will now work.

Fixed an implicit conversion error in the Butcher table for ESDIRK5(4)7L[2]SA2.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 6.4.1
====================================

Fixed a bug with the Kokkos interfaces that would arise when using clang.

Fixed a compilation error with the Intel oneAPI 2022.2 Fortran compiler in the
Fortran 2003 interface test for the serial :c:type:`N_Vector`.

Fixed a bug in the LAPACK band and dense linear solvers which would cause the
tests to fail on some platforms.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 6.4.0
====================================

**New Requirements**

CMake 3.18.0 or newer is now required for CUDA support.

A C++14 compliant compiler is now required for C++ based features and examples
e.g., CUDA, HIP, RAJA, Trilinos, SuperLU_DIST, MAGMA, Ginkgo, and Kokkos.

**Major Features**

Added support for the `Ginkgo <https://ginkgo-project.github.io/>`_ linear
algebra library. This support includes new SUNDIALS matrix and linear solver
implementations, see the sections :numref:`SUNMatrix.Ginkgo` and
:numref:`SUNLinSol.Ginkgo`.

Added new SUNDIALS vector, dense matrix, and dense linear solver implementations
utilizing the `Kokkos Ecosystem <https://kokkos.org/>`_ for performance
portability, see sections :numref:`NVectors.Kokkos`, :numref:`SUNMatrix.Kokkos`,
and :numref:`SUNLinSol.Kokkos` for more information.

**New Features**

Added support for GPU enabled SuperLU_DIST and SuperLU_DIST v8.x.x. Removed
support for SuperLU_DIST v6.x.x or older. Fix mismatched definition and
declaration bug in SuperLU_DIST matrix constructor.

Added the functions following functions to load a Butcher table from a string:

* :c:func:`ARKStepSetTableName`
* :c:func:`ERKStepSetTableName`
* :c:func:`MRIStepCoupling_LoadTableByName`
* :c:func:`ARKodeButcherTable_LoadDIRKByName`
* :c:func:`ARKodeButcherTable_LoadERKByName`

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed a bug in the CUDA and HIP vectors where :c:func:`N_VMaxNorm` would return
the minimum positive floating-point value for the zero vector.

Fixed memory leaks/out of bounds memory accesses in the ARKODE MRIStep module
that could occur when attaching a coupling table after reinitialization with a
different number of stages than originally selected.

Fixed a memory leak where the projection memory would not be deallocated when
calling :c:func:`CVodeFree`.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 6.3.0
====================================

**New Features**

Added the following functions to retrieve the user data pointer provided with
``SetUserData`` functions:

* :c:func:`ARKStepGetUserData`
* :c:func:`ERKStepGetUserData`
* :c:func:`MRIStepGetUserData`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetUserData`
* :c:func:`IDAGetUserData`
* :c:func:`KINGetUserData`

Added a variety of embedded DIRK methods from :cite:p:`KenCarp:16` and
:cite:p:`KenCarp:19b`.

Updated :c:func:`MRIStepReset` to call the corresponding
:c:type:`MRIStepInnerResetFn` with the same ``tR`` and ``yR`` arguments for the
:c:type:`MRIStepInnerStepper` object that is used to evolve the MRI "fast" time
scale subproblems.

Added a new example (``examples/cvode/serial/cvRocket_dns.c``) which
demonstrates using CVODE with a discontinuous right-hand-side function and
rootfinding.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed a bug in :c:func:`ERKStepReset`, :c:func:`ERKStepReInit`,
:c:func:`ARKStepReset`, :c:func:`ARKStepReInit`, :c:func:`MRIStepReset`, and
:c:func:`MRIStepReInit` where a previously-set value of ``tstop`` (from
a call to :c:func:`ERKStepSetStopTime`, :c:func:`ARKStepSetStopTime`, or
:c:func:`MRIStepSetStopTime`, respectively) would not be cleared.

Fixed the unituitive behavior of the ``USE_GENERIC_MATH`` CMake option which
caused the double precision math functions to be used regardless of the value of
:cmakeop:`SUNDIALS_PRECISION`. Now, SUNDIALS will use precision appropriate math
functions when they are available and the user may provide the math library to
link to via the advanced CMake option :cmakeop:`SUNDIALS_MATH_LIBRARY`.

Changed ``SUNDIALS_LOGGING_ENABLE_MPI`` CMake option default to be ``OFF``. This
fixes `GitHub Issue #177 <https://github.com/LLNL/sundials/issues/177>`_.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 6.2.0
====================================

**Major Features**

Added the :c:type:`SUNLogger` API which provides a SUNDIALS-wide mechanism for
logging of errors, warnings, informational output, and debugging output.

Added support to CVODES for integrating IVPs with constraints using BDF methods
and projecting the solution onto the constraint manifold with a user defined
projection function. This implementation is accompanied by additions to the
CVODES user documentation and examples.

**New Features**

Added the function :c:func:`SUNProfiler_Reset` to reset the region timings and
counters to zero.

Added the following functions to output all of the integrator, nonlinear solver,
linear solver, and other statistics in one call:

* :c:func:`ARKStepPrintAllStats`
* :c:func:`ERKStepPrintAllStats`
* :c:func:`MRIStepPrintAllStats`
* :c:func:`CVodePrintAllStats`
* :c:func:`IDAPrintAllStats`
* :c:func:`KINPrintAllStats`

The file ``scripts/sundials_csv.py`` contains functions for parsing the
comma-separated value (CSV) output files when using the CSV output format.

Added functions to CVODE, CVODES, IDA, and IDAS to change the default step size
adaptivity parameters. For more information see the documentation for:

* :c:func:`CVodeSetEtaFixedStepBounds`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetEtaMaxFirstStep`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetEtaMaxEarlyStep`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetNumStepsEtaMaxEarlyStep`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetEtaMax`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetEtaMin`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetEtaMinErrFail`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetEtaMaxErrFail`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetNumFailsEtaMaxErrFail`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetEtaConvFail`
* :c:func:`IDASetEtaFixedStepBounds`
* :c:func:`IDASetEtaMax`
* :c:func:`IDASetEtaMin`
* :c:func:`IDASetEtaLow`
* :c:func:`IDASetEtaMinErrFail`
* :c:func:`IDASetEtaConvFail`

Added the functions :c:func:`ARKStepSetDeduceImplicitRhs` and
:c:func:`MRIStepSetDeduceImplicitRhs` to optionally remove an evaluation of the
implicit right-hand side function after nonlinear solves. See
:ref:`ARKODE.Mathematics.Nonlinear`, for considerations on using this
optimization.

Added the function :c:func:`MRIStepSetOrder` to select the default MRI method of
a given order.

Added the functions :c:func:`CVodeSetDeltaGammaMaxLSetup` and
:c:func:`CVodeSetDeltaGammaMaxBadJac` in CVODE and CVODES to adjust the
:math:`\gamma` change thresholds to require a linear solver setup or
Jacobian/precondition update, respectively.

Added the function :c:func:`IDASetDeltaCjLSetup` in IDA and IDAS to adjust the
parameter that determines when a change in :math:`c_j` requires calling the
linear solver setup function.

Added the function :c:func:`IDASetMinStep` to set a minimum step size.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed the :c:type:`SUNContext` convenience class for C++ users to disallow copy
construction and allow move construction.

The behavior of :cpp:func:`N_VSetKernelExecPolicy_Sycl` has been updated to be
consistent with the CUDA and HIP vectors. The input execution policies are now
cloned and may be freed after calling
:cpp:func:`N_VSetKernelExecPolicy_Sycl`. Additionally, ``NULL`` inputs are now
allowed and, if provided, will reset the vector execution policies to the
defaults.

A memory leak in the SYCL vector was fixed where the execution policies were not
freed when the vector was destroyed.

The include guard in ``nvector_mpimanyvector.h`` has been corrected to enable
using both the ManyVector and MPIManyVector vector implementations
in the same simulation.

A bug was fixed in the ARKODE, CVODE(S), and IDA(S) functions to retrieve the
number of nonlinear solver failures. The failure count returned was the number
of failed *steps* due to a nonlinear solver failure i.e., if a nonlinear solve
failed with a stale Jacobian or preconditioner but succeeded after updating the
Jacobian or preconditioner, the initial failure was not included in the
nonlinear solver failure count. The following functions have been updated to
return the total number of nonlinear solver failures:

* :c:func:`ARKStepGetNumNonlinSolvConvFails`
* :c:func:`ARKStepGetNonlinSolvStats`
* :c:func:`MRIStepGetNumNonlinSolvConvFails`
* :c:func:`MRIStepGetNonlinSolvStats`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetNumNonlinSolvConvFails`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetNonlinSolvStats`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetSensNumNonlinSolvConvFails`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetSensNonlinSolvStats`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetStgrSensNumNonlinSolvConvFails`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetStgrSensNonlinSolvStats`
* :c:func:`IDAGetNumNonlinSolvConvFails`
* :c:func:`IDAGetNonlinSolvStats`
* :c:func:`IDAGetSensNumNonlinSolvConvFails`
* :c:func:`IDAGetSensNonlinSolvStats`

As a result of this change users may see an increase in the number of failures
reported from the above functions. The following functions have been added to
retrieve the number of failed steps due to a nonlinear solver failure i.e., the
counts previously returned by the above functions:

* :c:func:`ARKStepGetNumStepSolveFails`
* :c:func:`MRIStepGetNumStepSolveFails`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetNumStepSolveFails`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetNumStepSensSolveFails`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetNumStepStgrSensSolveFails`
* :c:func:`IDAGetNumStepSolveFails`
* :c:func:`IDAGetNumStepSensSolveFails`

Changed exported SUNDIALS PETSc CMake targets to be INTERFACE IMPORTED instead
of UNKNOWN IMPORTED.

**Deprecation Notice**

Deprecated the following functions, it is recommended to use the
:c:type:`SUNLogger` API instead.

* ``ARKStepSetDiagnostics``
* ``ERKStepSetDiagnostics``
* ``MRIStepSetDiagnostics``
* ``KINSetInfoFile``
* ``SUNNonlinSolSetPrintLevel_Newton``
* ``SUNNonlinSolSetInfoFile_Newton``
* ``SUNNonlinSolSetPrintLevel_FixedPoint``
* ``SUNNonlinSolSetInfoFile_FixedPoint``
* ``SUNLinSolSetInfoFile_PCG``
* ``SUNLinSolSetPrintLevel_PCG``
* ``SUNLinSolSetInfoFile_SPGMR``
* ``SUNLinSolSetPrintLevel_SPGMR``
* ``SUNLinSolSetInfoFile_SPFGMR``
* ``SUNLinSolSetPrintLevel_SPFGMR``
* ``SUNLinSolSetInfoFile_SPTFQM``
* ``SUNLinSolSetPrintLevel_SPTFQMR``
* ``SUNLinSolSetInfoFile_SPBCGS``
* ``SUNLinSolSetPrintLevel_SPBCGS``

The ``SUNLinSolSetInfoFile_*`` and ``SUNNonlinSolSetInfoFile_*`` family of
functions are now enabled by setting the CMake option
:cmakeop:`SUNDIALS_LOGGING_LEVEL` to a value ``>= 3``.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 6.1.1
====================================

**New Feature**

Added new Fortran example program,
``examples/arkode/F2003_serial/ark_kpr_mri_f2003.f90`` demonstrating MRI
capabilities.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed exported ``SUNDIALSConfig.cmake``.

Fixed Fortran interface to :c:type:`MRIStepInnerStepper` and
:c:type:`MRIStepCoupling` structures and functions.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 6.1.0
====================================

**New Features**

Added new reduction implementations for the CUDA and HIP vectors that use
shared memory (local data storage) instead of atomics. These new implementations
are recommended when the target hardware does not provide atomic support for the
floating point precision that SUNDIALS is being built with. The HIP vector uses
these by default, but the :c:func:`N_VSetKernelExecPolicy_Cuda` and
:c:func:`N_VSetKernelExecPolicy_Hip` functions can be used to choose between
different reduction implementations.

``SUNDIALS::<lib>`` targets with no static/shared suffix have been added for use
within the build directory (this mirrors the targets exported on installation).

:cmakeop:`CMAKE_C_STANDARD` is now set to ``99`` by default.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed exported ``SUNDIALSConfig.cmake`` when profiling is enabled without
Caliper.

Fixed ``sundials_export.h`` include in ``sundials_config.h``.

Fixed memory leaks in the SuperLU_MT linear solver interface.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 6.0.0
====================================

**Breaking Changes**

*SUNContext Object Added*

SUNDIALS v6.0.0 introduces a new :c:type:`SUNContext` object on which all other
SUNDIALS objects depend. As such, the constructors for all SUNDIALS packages,
vectors, matrices, linear solvers, nonlinear solvers, and memory helpers have
been updated to accept a context as the last input. Users upgrading to SUNDIALS
v6.0.0 will need to call :c:func:`SUNContext_Create` to create a context object
with before calling any other SUNDIALS library function, and then provide this
object to other SUNDIALS constructors. The context object has been introduced to
allow SUNDIALS to provide new features, such as the profiling/instrumentation
also introduced in this release, while maintaining thread-safety. See the
:numref:`SUNDIALS.SUNContext` for more details.

The script ``scripts/upgrade-to-sundials-6-from-5.sh`` has been provided with
this release (and obtainable from the GitHub release page) to help ease the
transition to SUNDIALS v6.0.0. The script will add a ``SUNCTX_PLACEHOLDER``
argument to all of the calls to SUNDIALS constructors that now require a
:c:type:`SUNContext` object. It can also update deprecated SUNDIALS
constants/types to the new names. It can be run like this:

.. code-block:: console

   ./upgrade-to-sundials-6-from-5.sh <files to update>

*Updated SUNMemoryHelper Function Signatures*

The :c:type:`SUNMemoryHelper` functions :c:func:`SUNMemoryHelper_Alloc`,
:c:func:`SUNMemoryHelper_Dealloc`, and :c:func:`SUNMemoryHelper_Copy` have been
updated to accept an opaque handle as the last input. At a minimum, user-defined
:c:type:`SUNMemoryHelper` implementations will need to update these functions to
accept the additional argument. Typically, this handle is the execution stream
(e.g., a CUDA/HIP stream or SYCL queue) for the operation. The CUDA, HIP, and
SYCL implementations have been updated accordingly. Additionally, the
constructor :c:func:`SUNMemoryHelper_Sycl` has been updated to remove the SYCL
queue as an input.

*Deprecated Functions Removed*

The previously deprecated constructor ``N_VMakeWithManagedAllocator_Cuda`` and
the function ``N_VSetCudaStream_Cuda`` have been removed and replaced with
:c:func:`N_VNewWithMemHelp_Cuda` and :c:func:`N_VSetKernelExecPolicy_Cuda`
respectively.

The previously deprecated macros ``PVEC_REAL_MPI_TYPE`` and
``PVEC_INTEGER_MPI_TYPE`` have been removed and replaced with
``MPI_SUNREALTYPE`` and ``MPI_SUNINDEXTYPE`` respectively.

The following previously deprecated :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` functions have
been removed:

+-----------------------------+------------------------------------------+

The deprecated functions ``MRIStepGetCurrentButcherTables`` and
``MRIStepWriteButcher`` and the utility functions ``MRIStepSetTable`` and
``MRIStepSetTableNum`` have been removed. Users wishing to create an MRI-GARK
method from a Butcher table should use :c:func:`MRIStepCoupling_MIStoMRI` to
create the corresponding MRI coupling table and attach it with
:c:func:`MRIStepSetCoupling`.

The previously deprecated functions ``ARKStepSetMaxStepsBetweenLSet`` and
``ARKStepSetMaxStepsBetweenJac`` have been removed and replaced with
:c:func:`ARKStepSetLSetupFrequency` and :c:func:`ARKStepSetJacEvalFrequency`
respectively.

The previously deprecated function ``CVodeSetMaxStepsBetweenJac`` has been
removed and replaced with :c:func:`CVodeSetJacEvalFrequency`.

The ARKODE, CVODE, IDA, and KINSOL Fortran 77 interfaces has been removed. See
:numref:`SUNDIALS.Fortran` and the F2003 example programs for more details using
the SUNDIALS Fortran 2003 module interfaces.

*Namespace Changes*

The CUDA, HIP, and SYCL execution policies have been moved from the ``sundials``
namespace to the ``sundials::cuda``, ``sundials::hip``, and ``sundials::sycl``
namespaces respectively. Accordingly, the prefixes "Cuda", "Hip", and "Sycl"
have been removed from the execution policy classes and methods.

The ``Sundials`` namespace used by the Trilinos Tpetra :c:type:`N_Vector`
implementation has been replaced with the ``sundials::trilinos::nvector_tpetra``
namespace.

**Major Features**

*Profiling Capability*

A capability to profile/instrument SUNDIALS library code has been added. This
can be enabled with the CMake option :cmakeop:`SUNDIALS_BUILD_WITH_PROFILING`. A
built-in profiler will be used by default, but the `Caliper
<https://github.com/LLNL/Caliper>`_ library can also be used instead with the
CMake option :cmakeop:`ENABLE_CALIPER`. See the documentation section on
profiling for more details.

.. warning::

   Profiling will impact performance, and should be enabled judiciously.

*IMEX MRI Methods and MRIStepInnerStepper Object*

The MRIStep module has been extended to support implicit-explicit (ImEx)
multirate infinitesimal generalized additive Runge--Kutta (MRI-GARK) methods. As
such, :c:func:`MRIStepCreate` has been updated to include arguments for the slow
explicit and slow implicit ODE right-hand side functions.
:c:func:`MRIStepCreate` has also been updated to require attaching an
MRIStepInnerStepper for evolving the fast time scale. :c:func:`MRIStepReInit`
has been similarly updated to take explicit and implicit right-hand side
functions as input. Codes using explicit or implicit MRI methods will need to
update :c:func:`MRIStepCreate` and :c:func:`MRIStepReInit` calls to pass
``NULL`` for either the explicit or implicit right-hand side function as
appropriate. If ARKStep is used as the fast time scale integrator, codes will
need to call :c:func:`ARKStepCreateMRIStepInnerStepper` to wrap the ARKStep
memory as an MRIStepInnerStepper object. Additionally,
:c:func:`MRIStepGetNumRhsEvals` has been updated to return the number of slow
implicit and explicit function evaluations. The coupling table,
:c:type:`MRIStepCoupling`, and the functions :c:func:`MRIStepCoupling_Alloc`
and :c:func:`MRIStepCoupling_Create` have also been updated to support
IMEX-MRI-GARK methods.

**New Features**

Two new optional vector operations, :c:func:`N_VDotProdMultiLocal` and
:c:func:`N_VDotProdMultiAllReduce`, have been added to support
low-synchronization methods for Anderson acceleration.

The implementation of solve-decoupled implicit MRI-GARK methods has been updated
to remove extraneous slow implicit function calls and reduce the memory
requirements.

Added a new function :c:func:`CVodeGetLinSolveStats` to get the CVODES linear
solver statistics as a group.

Added a new function, :c:func:`CVodeSetMonitorFn`, that takes a user-function
to be called by CVODES after every ``nst`` successfully completed time-steps.
This is intended to provide a way of monitoring the CVODES statistics
throughout the simulation.

New orthogonalization methods were added for use within the KINSOL Anderson
acceleration routine. See :ref:`Anderson_QR` and :c:func:`KINSetOrthAA`
for more details.

**Deprecation Notice**

The serial, PThreads, PETSc, *hypre*, Parallel, OpenMP_DEV, and OpenMP vector
functions ``N_VCloneVectorArray_*`` and ``N_VDestroyVectorArray_*`` have been
deprecated. The generic :c:func:`N_VCloneVectorArray` and
:c:func:`N_VDestroyVectorArray` functions should be used instead.

Many constants, types, and functions have been renamed so that they are properly
namespaced. The old names have been deprecated and will be removed in SUNDIALS
v7.0.0.

The following constants, macros, and typedefs are now deprecated:

In addition, the entire ``sundials_lapack.h`` header file is now deprecated for
removal in SUNDIALS v7.0.0. Note, this header file is not needed to use the
SUNDIALS LAPACK linear solvers.

Deprecated "bootstrap" and "minimum correction" predictors in ARKStep (options 4
and 5 to :c:func:`ARKStepSetPredictorMethod`) and the "bootstrap" predictor in
MRIStep (option 4 to :c:func:`MRIStepSetPredictorMethod`). These functions will
output a deprecation warning message and will be removed in a future release.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.8.0
====================================

**New Features**

The :ref:`RAJA vector <NVectors.RAJA>` implementation has been updated to
support the SYCL backend in addition to the CUDA and HIP backend. Users can
choose the backend when configuring SUNDIALS by using the
:cmakeop:`SUNDIALS_RAJA_BACKENDS` CMake variable. This vector remains
experimental and is subject to change from version to version.

New :c:type:`SUNMatrix` and :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` implementation were added
to interface with the Intel oneAPI Math Kernel Library (oneMKL). Both the matrix
and the linear solver support general dense linear systems as well as block
diagonal linear systems. See :numref:`SUNLinSol.OneMklDense` for more
details. This matrix is experimental and is subject to change from version to
version.

Added a new *optional* function to the SUNLinearSolver API,
:c:func:`SUNLinSolSetZeroGuess`, to indicate that the next call to
:c:func:`SUNLinSolSolve` will be made with a zero initial guess. SUNLinearSolver
implementations that do not use the :c:func:`SUNLinSolNewEmpty` constructor
will, at a minimum, need set the ``setzeroguess`` function pointer in the linear
solver ``ops`` structure to ``NULL``. The SUNDIALS iterative linear solver
implementations have been updated to leverage this new set function to remove
one dot product per solve.

The time integrator packages (ARKODE, CVODE(S), and IDA(S)) all now support a
new "matrix-embedded" :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` type. This type supports
user-supplied SUNLinearSolver implementations that set up and solve the
specified linear system at each linear solve call. Any matrix-related data
structures are held internally to the linear solver itself, and are not provided
by the SUNDIALS package.

Added functions to ARKODE and CVODE(S) for supplying an alternative right-hand
side function and to IDA(S) for supplying an alternative residual for use within
nonlinear system function evaluations:

* :c:func:`ARKStepSetNlsRhsFn`
* :c:func:`MRIStepSetNlsRhsFn`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetNlsRhsFn`
* :c:func:`IDASetNlsResFn`

Support for user-defined inner (fast) integrators has been to the MRIStep
module. See :ref:`ARKODE.Usage.MRIStep.CustomInnerStepper` for more information on providing
a user-defined integration method.

Added specialized fused HIP kernels to CVODE which may offer better performance
on smaller problems when using CVODE with the HIP vector. See the optional input
function :c:func:`CVodeSetUseIntegratorFusedKernels` for more information. As
with other SUNDIALS HIP features, this capability is considered experimental and
may change from version to version.

New KINSOL options have been added to apply a constant damping factor in the
fixed point and Picard iterations (see :c:func:`KINSetDamping`), to delay the
start of Anderson acceleration with the fixed point and Picard iterations (see
:c:func:`KINSetDelayAA`), and to return the newest solution with the fixed point
iteration (see :c:func:`KINSetReturnNewest`).

The installed ``SUNDIALSConfig.cmake`` file now supports the ``COMPONENTS``
option to ``find_package``. The exported targets no longer have IMPORTED_GLOBAL
set.

**Bug Fixes**

A bug was fixed in :c:func:`SUNMatCopyOps` where the matrix-vector product setup
function pointer was not copied.

A bug was fixed in the :ref:`SPBCGS <SUNLinSol.SPBCGS>` and :ref:`SPTFQMR
<SUNLinSol.SPTFQMR>` solvers for the case where a non-zero initial guess and a
solution scaling vector are provided. This fix only impacts codes using SPBCGS
or SPTFQMR as standalone solvers as all SUNDIALS packages utilize a zero initial
guess.

A bug was fixed in the ARKODE stepper modules where the stop time may be passed
after resetting the integrator.

A bug was fixed in :c:func:`IDASetJacTimesResFn` in IDAS where the supplied
function was used in the dense finite difference Jacobian computation rather
than the finite difference Jacobian-vector product approximation.

A bug was fixed in the KINSOL Picard iteration where the value of
:c:func:`KINSetMaxSetupCalls` would be ignored.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.7.0
====================================

A new :c:type:`N_Vector` implementation based on the SYCL abstraction layer has
been added targeting Intel GPUs. At present the only SYCL compiler supported is
the DPC++ (Intel oneAPI) compiler. See :numref:`NVectors.SYCL` for more
details. This vector is considered experimental and is subject to major changes
even in minor releases.

A new :c:type:`SUNMatrix` and :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` implementation were
added to interface with the MAGMA linear algebra library. Both the matrix and
the linear solver support general dense linear systems as well as block diagonal
linear systems, and both are targeted at GPUs (AMD or NVIDIA). See
:numref:`SUNLinSol.MagmaDense` for more details.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.6.1
====================================

Fixed a CMake bug which caused an error if the :cmakeop:`CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` and
:cmakeop:`SUNDIALS_RAJA_BACKENDS` options were not provided.

Fixed some compiler warnings when using the IBM XL compilers.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.6.0
====================================

A new :c:type:`N_Vector` implementation based on the AMD ROCm HIP platform has
been added. This vector can target NVIDIA or AMD GPUs. See
:numref:`NVectors.hip` for more details. This vector is considered experimental
and is subject to change from version to version.

The :ref:`RAJA vector <NVectors.RAJA>` implementation has been updated to
support the HIP backend in addition to the CUDA backend. Users can choose the
backend when configuring SUNDIALS by using the :cmakeop:`SUNDIALS_RAJA_BACKENDS`
CMake variable. This vector remains experimental and is subject to change from
version to version.

A new optional operation, :c:func:`N_VGetDeviceArrayPointer`, was added to the
N_Vector API. This operation is useful for vectors that utilize dual memory
spaces, e.g. the native SUNDIALS CUDA N_Vector.

The SUNDIALS matrix and linear solver interfaces to the :ref:`cuSparse matrix
<SUNMatrix.cuSparse>` and :ref:`cuSolver batched QR solver
<SUNLinSol.cuSolverSp>` no longer require using the CUDA
:c:type:`N_Vector`. Instead, they require that the vector utilized provides the
:c:func:`N_VGetDeviceArrayPointer` operation, and that the pointer returned by
:c:func:`N_VGetDeviceArrayPointer` is a valid CUDA device pointer.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.5.0
====================================

Refactored the SUNDIALS build system. CMake 3.12.0 or newer is now required.
Users will likely see deprecation warnings, but otherwise the changes
should be fully backwards compatible for almost all users. SUNDIALS
now exports CMake targets and installs a ``SUNDIALSConfig.cmake`` file.

Added support for SuperLU DIST 6.3.0 or newer.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.4.0
====================================

**Major Features**

A new class, :c:type:`SUNMemoryHelper`, was added to support **GPU users** who
have complex memory management needs such as using memory pools. This is paired
with new constructors for the CUDA and RAJA vectors that accept a
:c:type:`SUNMemoryHelper` object. Refer to :numref:`SUNDIALS.GPU`,
:numref:`SUNMemory`, :numref:`NVectors.cuda` and :numref:`NVectors.raja` for
more information.

Added full support for time-dependent mass matrices in ARKStep, and expanded
existing non-identity mass matrix infrastructure to support use of the
fixed point nonlinear solver.

An interface between ARKStep and the XBraid multigrid reduction in time (MGRIT)
library :cite:p:`xbraid` has been added to enable parallel-in-time integration. See the
:ref:`ARKODE.Usage.ARKStep.XBraid` section for more information and the example
codes in ``examples/arkode/CXX_xbraid``. This interface required the addition of
three new N_Vector operations to exchange vector data between computational
nodes, see :c:func:`N_VBufSize`, :c:func:`N_VBufPack`, and
:c:func:`N_VBufUnpack`. These N_Vector operations are only used within the
XBraid interface and need not be implemented for any other context.

**New Features**

The :ref:`RAJA vector <NVectors.RAJA>` has been updated to mirror the CUDA
vector. Notably, the update adds managed memory support to the RAJA vector.
Users of the vector will need to update any calls to the :c:func:`N_VMake_Raja`
function because that signature was changed. This vector remains experimental
and is subject to change from version to version.

The expected behavior of :c:func:`SUNNonlinSolGetNumIters` and
:c:func:`SUNNonlinSolGetNumConvFails` in the :c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` API
have been updated to specify that they should return the number of nonlinear
solver iterations and convergence failures in the most recent solve respectively
rather than the cumulative number of iterations and failures across all solves
respectively. The API documentation and SUNDIALS provided
:c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` implementations have been updated accordingly. As
before, the cumulative number of nonlinear iterations and failures may be
retrieved with the following functions:

* :c:func:`ARKStepGetNumNonlinSolvIters`
* :c:func:`ARKStepGetNumNonlinSolvConvFails`
* :c:func:`ARKStepGetNonlinSolvStats`
* :c:func:`MRIStepGetNumNonlinSolvIters`
* :c:func:`MRIStepGetNumNonlinSolvConvFails`
* :c:func:`MRIStepGetNonlinSolvStats`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetNumNonlinSolvIters`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetNumNonlinSolvConvFails`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetNonlinSolvStats`
* :c:func:`IDAGetNumNonlinSolvIters`
* :c:func:`IDAGetNumNonlinSolvConvFails`
* :c:func:`IDAGetNonlinSolvStats`

Added the following the following functions that advanced users might find
useful when providing a custom :c:func:`SUNNonlinSolSysFn`:

* :c:func:`ARKStepComputeState`
* :c:func:`ARKStepGetNonlinearSystemData`
* :c:func:`MRIStepComputeState`
* :c:func:`MRIStepGetNonlinearSystemData`
* :c:func:`CVodeComputeState`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetNonlinearSystemData`
* :c:func:`IDAGetNonlinearSystemData`

Added new functions to CVODE(S), ARKODE, and IDA(S) to to specify the factor for
converting between integrator tolerances (WRMS norm) and linear solver tolerances
(L2 norm) i.e., ``tol_L2 = nrmfac * tol_WRMS``:

* :c:func:`ARKStepSetLSNormFactor`
* :c:func:`ARKStepSetMassLSNormFactor`
* :c:func:`MRIStepSetLSNormFactor`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetLSNormFactor`
* :c:func:`IDASetLSNormFactor`

Added new reset functions :c:func:`ARKStepReset`, :c:func:`ERKStepReset`,
and :c:func:`MRIStepReset` to reset the stepper time and state vector to
user-provided values for continuing the integration from that point while
retaining the integration history. These function complement the
reinitialization functions :c:func:`ARKStepReInit`, :c:func:`ERKStepReInit`,
and :c:func:`MRIStepReInit` which reinitialize the stepper so that the problem
integration should resume as if started from scratch.

Updated the MRIStep time-stepping module in ARKODE to support higher-order
MRI-GARK methods :cite:p:`Sandu:19`, including methods that involve
solve-decoupled, diagonally-implicit treatment of the slow time scale.

The function :c:func:`CVodeSetLSetupFrequency` has been added to CVODE(S) to set
the frequency of calls to the linear solver setup function.

The Trilinos Tpetra :c:type:`N_Vector` interface has been updated to work with
Trilinos 12.18+. This update changes the local ordinal type to always be an
``int``.

Added support for CUDA 11.

**Bug Fixes**

A minor inconsistency in CVODE(S) and a bug ARKODE when checking the Jacobian
evaluation frequency has been fixed. As a result codes using using a non-default
Jacobian update frequency through a call to ``CVodeSetMaxStepsBetweenJac``
or ``ARKStepSetMaxStepsBetweenJac`` will need to increase the provided
value by 1 to achieve the same behavior as before.

In IDAS and CVODES, the functions for forward integration with checkpointing
(:c:func:`IDASolveF`, :c:func:`CVodeF`) are now subject to a restriction on the
number of time steps allowed to reach the output time. This is the same
restriction applied to :c:func:`IDASolve` and :c:func:`CVode`. The default
maximum number of steps is ``500``, but this may be changed using the
:c:func:`CVodeSetMaxNumSteps` and :c:func:`IDASetMaxNumSteps` function. This
change fixes a bug that could cause an infinite loop in :c:func:`IDASolveF` and
:c:func:`CVodeF`. **This change may cause a runtime error in existing user
code**.

Fixed bug in using ERK method integration with static mass matrices.

**Deprecation Notice**

For greater clarity the following functions have been deprecated:

* ``CVodeSetMaxStepsBetweenJac``
* ``ARKStepSetMaxStepsBetweenJac``
* ``ARKStepSetMaxStepsBetweenLSet``

The following functions should be used instead:

* :c:func:`CVodeSetJacEvalFrequency`
* :c:func:`ARKStepSetJacEvalFrequency`
* :c:func:`ARKStepSetLSetupFrequency`

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.3.0
====================================

**Major Feature**

Added support to CVODE for integrating IVPs with constraints using BDF methods
and projecting the solution onto the constraint manifold with a user defined
projection function. This implementation is accompanied by additions to user
documentation and CVODE examples. See :c:func:`CVodeSetProjFn` for more
information.

**New Features**

Added the ability to control the CUDA kernel launch parameters for the CUDA
vector and spare matrix implementations. These implementations remain
experimental and are subject to change from version to version. In addition, the
CUDA vector kernels were rewritten to be more flexible. Most users should see
equivalent performance or some improvement, but a select few may observe minor
performance degradation with the default settings. Users are encouraged to
contact the SUNDIALS team about any performance changes that they notice.

Added new capabilities for monitoring the solve phase in the Newton and
fixed-point :c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver`, and the SUNDIALS iterative linear
solvers. SUNDIALS must be built with the CMake option
:cmakeop:`SUNDIALS_BUILD_WITH_MONITORING` to use these capabilities.

Added specialized fused CUDA kernels to CVODE which may offer better performance
on smaller problems when using CVODE with the CUDA vector. See the optional
input function :c:func:`CVodeSetUseIntegratorFusedKernels` for more
information. As with other SUNDIALS CUDA features, this is feature is
experimental and may change from version to version.

Added a new function, :c:func:`CVodeSetMonitorFn`, that takes a user-function
to be called by CVODE after every ``nst`` successfully completed time-steps.
This is intended to provide a way of monitoring the CVODE statistics
throughout the simulation.

Added a new function :c:func:`CVodeGetLinSolveStats` to get the CVODE linear solver
statistics as a group.

Added the following optional functions to provide an alternative ODE right-hand
side function (ARKODE and CVODE(S)), DAE residual function (IDA(S)), or nonlinear
system function (KINSOL) for use when computing Jacobian-vector products with
the internal difference quotient approximation:

* :c:func:`ARKStepSetJacTimesRhsFn`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetJacTimesRhsFn`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetJacTimesRhsFnB`
* :c:func:`IDASetJacTimesResFn`
* :c:func:`IDASetJacTimesResFnB`
* :c:func:`KINSetJacTimesVecSysFn`

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed a bug in the iterative linear solvers where an error is not returned if
the ``Atimes`` function is ``NULL`` or, if preconditioning is enabled, the
``PSolve`` function is ``NULL``.

Fixed a bug in ARKODE where the prototypes for :c:func:`ERKStepSetMinReduction`
and :c:func:`ARKStepSetMinReduction` were not included in ``arkode_erkstep.h``
and ``arkode_arkstep.h`` respectively.

Fixed a bug in ARKODE where inequality constraint checking would need to be
disabled and then re-enabled to update the inequality constraint values after
resizing a problem. Resizing a problem will now disable constraints and a call
to :c:func:`ARKStepSetConstraints` or :c:func:`ERKStepSetConstraints` is
required to re-enable constraint checking for the new problem size.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.2.0
====================================

**New Features**

The following functions were added to each of the time integration packages to
enable or disable the scaling applied to linear system solutions with
matrix-based linear solvers to account for lagged matrix information:

* :c:func:`ARKStepSetLinearSolutionScaling`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetLinearSolutionScaling`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetLinearSolutionScalingB`
* :c:func:`IDASetLinearSolutionScaling`
* :c:func:`IDASetLinearSolutionScalingB`

When using a matrix-based linear solver with ARKODE, IDA(S), or BDF methods in
CVODE(S) scaling is enabled by default.

Added a new :c:type:`SUNMatrix` implementation that interfaces to the sparse
matrix implementation from the NVIDIA cuSPARSE library, see
:numref:`SUNMatrix.cuSparse` for more details. In addition, the CUDA Sparse
linear solver has been updated to use the new matrix, as such, users of this
matrix will need to update their code. This implementations are still considered
to be experimental, thus they are subject to breaking changes even in minor
releases.

Added a new "stiff" interpolation module to ARKODE, based on Lagrange polynomial
interpolation, that is accessible to each of the ARKStep, ERKStep and MRIStep
time-stepping modules. This module is designed to provide increased
interpolation accuracy when integrating stiff problems, as opposed to the
ARKODE-standard Hermite interpolation module that can suffer when the IVP
right-hand side has large Lipschitz constant. While the Hermite module remains
the default, the new Lagrange module may be enabled using one of the routines
:c:func:`ARKStepSetInterpolantType`, :c:func:`ERKStepSetInterpolantType`, or
:c:func:`MRIStepSetInterpolantType`. The serial example problem
``ark_brusselator.c`` has been converted to use this Lagrange interpolation
module. Created accompanying routines :c:func:`ARKStepSetInterpolantDegree`,
:c:func:`ARKStepSetInterpolantDegree` and :c:func:`ARKStepSetInterpolantDegree`
to provide user control over these interpolating polynomials.

Added two new functions, :c:func:`ARKStepSetMinReduction` and
:c:func:`ERKStepSetMinReduction`, to change the minimum allowed step size
reduction factor after an error test failure.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed a build system bug related to the Fortran 2003 interfaces when using the
IBM XL compiler. When building the Fortran 2003 interfaces with an XL compiler
it is recommended to set :cmakeop:`CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER` to ``f2003``,
``xlf2003``, or ``xlf2003_r``.

Fixed a bug in how ARKODE interfaces with a user-supplied, iterative, unscaled
linear solver. In this case, ARKODE adjusts the linear solver tolerance in an
attempt to account for the lack of support for left/right scaling matrices.
Previously, ARKODE computed this scaling factor using the error weight vector,
``ewt``; this fix changes that to the residual weight vector, ``rwt``, that can
differ from ``ewt`` when solving problems with non-identity mass matrix.

Fixed a linkage bug affecting Windows users that stemmed from
dllimport/dllexport attribute missing on some SUNDIALS API functions.

Fixed a memory leak in CVODES and IDAS from not deallocating the ``atolSmin0``
and ``atolQSmin0`` arrays.

Fixed a bug where a non-default value for the maximum allowed growth factor
after the first step would be ignored.

**Deprecation Notice**

The routines :c:func:`ARKStepSetDenseOrder`,  :c:func:`ARKStepSetDenseOrder` and
:c:func:`ARKStepSetDenseOrder` have been deprecated and will be removed in a
future release. The new functions :c:func:`ARKStepSetInterpolantDegree`,
:c:func:`ARKStepSetInterpolantDegree`, and :c:func:`ARKStepSetInterpolantDegree`
should be used instead.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.1.0
====================================

**New Features**

Added support for a user-supplied function to update the prediction for each
implicit stage solution in ARKStep. If supplied, this routine will be called
*after* any existing ARKStep predictor algorithm completes, so that the
predictor may be modified by the user as desired. The new user-supplied routine
has type :c:type:`ARKStagePredictFn`, and may be set by calling
:c:func:`ARKStepSetStagePredictFn`.

The MRIStep module has been updated to support attaching different user data
pointers to the inner and outer integrators. If applicable, user codes will need
to add a call to :c:func:`ARKStepSetUserData` to attach their user data pointer
to the inner integrator memory as :c:func:`MRIStepSetUserData` will not set the
pointer for both the inner and outer integrators. The MRIStep examples have been
updated to reflect this change.

Added support for damping when using Anderson acceleration in KINSOL. See the
:ref:`KINSOL.Mathematics` and the description of the
:c:func:`KINSetDampingAA` function for more details.

Added support for constant damping to the fixed-point
:c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` when using Anderson acceleration. See
:ref:`SUNNonlinSol.FixedPoint.Math` and the
:c:func:`SUNNonlinSolSetDamping_FixedPoint` for more details.

Added two utility functions, :c:func:`SUNDIALSFileOpen` and
:c:func:`SUNDIALSFileClose` for creating/destroying file pointers. These are
useful when using the Fortran 2003 interfaces.

Added a new build system option, ``CUDA_ARCH``, to specify the CUDA
architecture to target.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed a build system bug related to finding LAPACK/BLAS.

Fixed a build system bug related to checking if the KLU library works.

Fixed a build system bug related to finding PETSc when using the CMake
variables :cmakeop:`PETSC_INCLUDES` and :cmakeop:`PETSC_LIBRARIES` instead of
:cmakeop:`PETSC_DIR`.

Fixed a bug in the Fortran 2003 interfaces to the ARKODE Butcher table routines
and structure. This includes changing the :c:type:`ARKodeButcherTable` type to
be a ``type(c_ptr)`` in Fortran.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 5.0.0
====================================

**Build System**

Increased the minimum required CMake version to 3.5 for most SUNDIALS
configurations, and 3.10 when CUDA or OpenMP with device offloading are enabled.

The CMake option ``BLAS_ENABLE`` and the variable ``BLAS_LIBRARIES`` have been
removed to simplify builds as SUNDIALS packages do not use BLAS directly. For
third party libraries that require linking to BLAS, the path to the BLAS library
should be included in the ``_LIBRARIES`` variable for the third party library
e.g., :cmakeop:`SUPERLUDIST_LIBRARIES` when enabling SuperLU_DIST.

**NVector**

Two new functions were added to aid in creating custom :c:type:`N_Vector`
objects. The constructor :c:func:`N_VNewEmpty` allocates an "empty" generic
:c:type:`N_Vector` with the object's content pointer and the function pointers
in the operations structure initialized to ``NULL``. When used in the
constructor for custom objects this function will ease the introduction of any
new optional operations to the :c:type:`N_Vector` API by ensuring only required
operations need to be set. Additionally, the function :c:func:`N_VCopyOps` has
been added to copy the operation function pointers between vector objects. When
used in clone routines for custom vector objects these functions also will ease
the introduction of any new optional operations to the :c:type:`N_Vector` API by
ensuring all operations are copied when cloning objects.

Added new :c:type:`N_Vector` implementations, :ref:`ManyVector
<NVectors.ManyVector>` and :ref:`MPIManyVector <NVectors.MPIManyVector>`, to
support flexible partitioning of solution data among different processing
elements (e.g., CPU + GPU) or for multi-physics problems that couple distinct
MPI-based simulations together (see the :numref:`NVectors.ManyVector` and
:numref:`NVectors.MPIManyVector` for more details). This implementation is
accompanied by additions to user documentation and SUNDIALS examples.

Additionally, an :ref:`MPIPlusX vector <NVectors.MPIPlusX>` implementation has been
created to support the MPI+X paradigm where X is a type of on-node parallelism
(e.g., OpenMP, CUDA, etc.). The implementation is accompanied by additions to
user documentation and SUNDIALS examples.

One new required vector operation and ten new optional vector operations have
been added to the :c:type:`N_Vector` API. The new required operation,
:c:func:`N_VGetLength`, returns the global vector length. The optional
operations have been added to support the new MPIManyVector implementation. The
operation :c:func:`N_VGetCommunicator` must be implemented by subvectors that
are combined to create an MPIManyVector, but is not used outside of this
context. The remaining nine operations are optional local reduction operations
intended to eliminate unnecessary latency when performing vector reduction
operations (norms, etc.) on distributed memory systems. The optional local
reduction vector operations are :c:type:`N_VDotProdLocal`,
:c:type:`N_VMaxNormLocal`, :c:type:`N_VMinLocal`, :c:type:`N_VL1NormLocal`,
:c:type:`N_VWSqrSumLocal`, :c:type:`N_VWSqrSumMaskLocal`,
:c:type:`N_VInvTestLocal`, :c:type:`N_VConstrMaskLocal`, and
:c:type:`N_VMinQuotientLocal`. If an :c:type:`N_Vector` implementation defines
any of the local operations as ``NULL``, then the MPIManyVector will call
standard :c:type:`N_Vector` operations to complete the computation.

The ``*_MPICuda`` and ``*_MPIRaja`` functions have been removed from the CUDA
and RAJA vector implementations respectively. Accordingly, the
``nvector_mpicuda.h``, ``nvector_mpiraja.h``, ``libsundials_nvecmpicuda.lib``,
and ``libsundials_nvecmpicudaraja.lib`` files have been removed. Users should
use the MPI+X vector in conjunction with the CUDA and RAJA vectors to replace
the functionality. The necessary changes are minimal and should require few code
modifications. See the example programs in ``examples/ida/mpicuda`` and
``examples/ida/mpiraja`` for examples of how to use the MPI+X vector with the
CUDA and RAJA vectors, respectively.

Made performance improvements to the CUDA vector. Users who utilize a
non-default stream should no longer see default stream synchronizations after
memory transfers.

Added a new constructor to the CUDA vector that allows a user to provide custom
allocate and free functions for the vector data array and internal reduction
buffer.

Added three new :c:type:`N_Vector` utility functions,
:c:func:`N_VGetVecAtIndexVectorArray`, :c:func:`N_VSetVecAtIndexVectorArray`,
and :c:func:`N_VNewVectorArray`, for working with :c:type:`N_Vector` arrays when
using the Fortran 2003 interfaces.

**SUNMatrix**

Two new functions were added to aid in creating custom :c:type:`SUNMatrix`
objects. The constructor :c:func:`SUNMatNewEmpty` allocates an "empty" generic
:c:type:`SUNMatrix` with the object's content pointer and the function pointers
in the operations structure initialized to ``NULL``. When used in the
constructor for custom objects this function will ease the introduction of any
new optional operations to the :c:type:`SUNMatrix` API by ensuring only required
operations need to be set. Additionally, the function :c:func:`SUNMatCopyOps`
has been added to copy the operation function pointers between matrix
objects. When used in clone routines for custom matrix objects these functions
also will ease the introduction of any new optional operations to the
:c:type:`SUNMatrix` API by ensuring all operations are copied when cloning
objects.

A new operation, :c:func:`SUNMatMatvecSetup`, was added to the
:c:type:`SUNMatrix` API to perform any setup necessary for computing a
matrix-vector product. This operation is useful for :c:type:`SUNMatrix`
implementations which need to prepare the matrix itself, or communication
structures before performing the matrix-vector product. Users who have
implemented a custom :c:type:`SUNMatrix` will need to at least update their code
to set the corresponding ``ops`` structure member, ``matvecsetup``, to ``NULL``.

The generic :c:type:`SUNMatrix` API now defines error codes to be returned by
matrix operations. Operations which return an integer flag indiciating
success/failure may return different values than previously.

A new :c:type:`SUNMatrix` (and :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver`) implementation was
added to facilitate the use of the SuperLU_DIST library with SUNDIALS.

**SUNLinearSolver**

A new function was added to aid in creating custom :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver`
objects. The constructor :c:func:`SUNLinSolNewEmpty` allocates an "empty"
generic :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` with the object's content pointer and the
function pointers in the operations structure initialized to ``NULL``. When used
in the constructor for custom objects this function will ease the introduction
of any new optional operations to the :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` API by ensuring
only required operations need to be set.

The return type of the :c:type:`SUNLinSolLastFlag` in the
:c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` has changed from ``long int`` to
:c:type:`sunindextype` to be consistent with the type used to store row indices
in dense and banded linear solver modules.

Added a new optional operation to the :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` API,
:c:func:`SUNLinSolGetID`, that returns a :c:enum:`SUNLinearSolver_ID` for
identifying the linear solver module.

The :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` API has been updated to make the initialize and
setup functions optional.

A new :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` (and :c:type:`SUNMatrix`) implementation was
added to facilitate the use of the SuperLU_DIST library with SUNDIALS.

Added a new :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` implementation, :ref:`cuSolverSp_batchQR
<SUNLinSol.cuSolverSp>`, which leverages the NVIDIA cuSOLVER sparse batched QR
method for efficiently solving block diagonal linear systems on NVIDIA GPUs.

Added three new accessor functions to the KLU linear solver to provide user
access to the underlying KLU solver structures:
:c:func:`SUNLinSol_KLUGetSymbolic`, :c:func:`SUNLinSol_KLUGetNumeric`, and
:c:func:`SUNLinSol_KLUGetCommon`.

**SUNNonlinearSolver**

A new function was added to aid in creating custom :c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver`
objects. The constructor :c:func:`SUNNonlinSolNewEmpty` allocates an "empty"
generic :c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` with the object's content pointer and the
function pointers in the operations structure initialized to ``NULL``. When used
in the constructor for custom objects this function will ease the introduction
of any new optional operations to the :c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` API by
ensuring only required operations need to be set.

To facilitate the use of user supplied nonlinear solver convergence test
functions the :c:func:`SUNNonlinSolSetConvTestFn` function in the
:c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` API has been updated to take a ``void*`` data
pointer as input. The supplied data pointer will be passed to the nonlinear
solver convergence test function on each call.

The inputs values passed to the first two inputs of the :c:func:`SUNNonlinSolSolve`
function in the :c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` have been changed to be the predicted
state and the initial guess for the correction to that state. Additionally,
the definitions of :c:func:`SUNNonlinSolLSetupFn` and :c:func:`SUNNonlinSolLSolveFn` in the
:c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` API have been updated to remove unused input parameters.
For more information on the nonlinear system formulation and the API functions
see :ref:`SUNNonlinSol`.

Added a new :c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` implementation for interfacing with the
:ref:`PETSc SNES <SUNNonlinSol.PetscSNES>` nonlinear solver.

**New Features**

A new linear solver interface functions, :c:type:`ARKLsLinSysFn` and
:c:type:`CVLsLinSysFn`, as added as an alternative method for evaluating the
linear systems :math:`M - \gamma J` or :math:`I - \gamma J`.

Added the following functions to get the current state and gamma value to
ARKStep, CVODE and CVODES that may be useful to users who choose to provide
their own nonlinear solver implementation:

* :c:func:`ARKStepGetCurrentState`
* :c:func:`ARKStepGetCurrentGamma`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetCurrentGamma`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetCurrentState`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetCurrentGamma`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetCurrentStateSens`
* :c:func:`CVodeGetCurrentSensSolveIndex`
* :c:func:`IDAGetCurrentCj`
* :c:func:`IDAGetCurrentY`
* :c:func:`IDAGetCurrentYp`
* :c:func:`IDAComputeY`
* :c:func:`IDAComputeYp`

Removed extraneous calls to :c:func:`N_VMin` for simulations where the scalar
valued absolute tolerance, or all entries of the vector-valued absolute
tolerance array, are strictly positive. In this scenario ARKODE, CVODE(S), and
IDA(S) steppers will remove at least one global reduction per time step.

The ARKODE, CVODE(S), IDA(S), and KINSOL linear solver interfaces have been
updated to only zero the Jacobian matrix before calling a user-supplied Jacobian
evaluation function when the attached linear solver has type
:c:type:`SUNLINEARSOLVER_DIRECT`.

Added new Fortran 2003 interfaces to all of the SUNDIALS packages (ARKODE,
CVODE(S), IDA(S), and KINSOL as well as most of the :c:type:`N_Vector`,
:c:type:`SUNMatrix`, :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver`, and :c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver`
implementations. See :numref:`SUNDIALS.Fortran` section for more details.
These new interfaces were generated with SWIG-Fortran and provide a user an
idiomatic Fortran 2003 interface to most of the SUNDIALS C API.

The MRIStep module has been updated to support explicit, implicit, or IMEX
methods as the fast integrator using the ARKStep module. As a result some
function signatures have been changed including :c:func:`MRIStepCreate` which
now takes an ARKStep memory structure for the fast integration as an input.

The reinitialization functions :c:func:`ERKStepReInit`, :c:func:`ARKStepReInit`,
and :c:func:`MRIStepReInit` have been updated to retain the minimum and maxiumum
step size values from before reinitialization rather than resetting them to the
default values.

Added two new embedded ARK methods of orders 4 and 5 to ARKODE (from
:cite:p:`KenCarp:19`).

Support for optional inequality constraints on individual components of the
solution vector has been added the ARKODE ERKStep and ARKStep modules. See the
descriptions of :c:func:`ERKStepSetConstraints` and
:c:func:`ARKStepSetConstraints` for more details. Note that enabling constraint
handling requires the :c:type:`N_Vector` operations :c:func:`N_VMinQuotient`,
:c:func:`N_VConstrMask`, and :c:func:`N_VCompare` that were not previously
required by ARKODE.

Add two new 'Set' functions to MRIStep, :c:func:`MRIStepSetPreInnerFn` and
:c:func:`MRIStepSetPostInnerFn`, for performing communication or memory transfers
needed before or after the inner integration.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed a bug in the build system that prevented the PThreads NVECTOR module from
being built.

Fixed a memory leak in the PETSc :c:type:`N_Vector` clone function.

Fixed a memeory leak in the ARKODE, CVODE, and IDA F77 interfaces when not using
the default nonlinear solver.

Fixed a bug in the ARKStep time-stepping module in ARKODE that would result in
an infinite loop if the nonlinear solver failed to converge more than the
maximum allowed times during a single step.

Fixed a bug in ARKODE that would result in a "too much accuracy requested" error
when using fixed time step sizes with explicit methods in some cases.

Fixed a bug in ARKStep where the mass matrix linear solver setup function was
not called in the Matrix-free case.

Fixed a minor bug in ARKStep where an incorrect flag is reported when an
error occurs in the mass matrix setup or Jacobian-vector product setup
functions.

Fixed a bug in the CVODE and CVODES constraint handling where the step size
could be set below the minimum step size.

Fixed a bug in the CVODE and CVODES nonlinear solver interfaces where the norm
of the accumulated correction was not updated when using a non-default
convergence test function.

Fixed a bug in the CVODES ``cvRescale`` function where the loops to compute the
array of scalars for the fused vector scale operation stopped one iteration
early.

Fixed a bug in CVODES and IDAS where :c:func:`CVodeF` and :c:func:`IDASolveF`
would return the wrong flag under certain circumstances.

Fixed a bug in CVODES and IDAS where :c:func:`CVodeF` and :c:func:`IDASolveF`
would not return a root in ``NORMAL_STEP`` mode if the root occurred after the
desired output time.

Fixed a bug in the IDA and IDAS linear solver interfaces where an incorrect
Jacobian-vector product increment was used with iterative solvers other than
SPGMR and SPFGMR.

Fixed a bug the IDAS :c:func:`IDAQuadReInitB` function where an incorrect memory
structure was passed to :c:func:`IDAQuadReInit`.

Fixed a bug in the KINSOL linear solver interface where the auxiliary scalar
``sJpnorm`` was not computed when necessary with the Picard iteration and the
auxiliary scalar ``sFdotJp`` was unnecessarily computed in some cases.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 4.1.0
====================================

**Removed Implementation Headers**

The implementation header files (``*_impl.h``) are no longer installed. This
means users who are directly accessing or manipulating package memory structures
will need to update their code to use the package's public API.

**New Features**

An additional :c:type:`N_Vector` implementation was added for interfacing with
the Tpetra vector from Trilinos library to facilitate interoperability between
SUNDIALS and Trilinos. This implementation is accompanied by additions to user
documentation and SUNDIALS examples.

**Bug Fixes**

The ``EXAMPLES_ENABLE_RAJA`` CMake option has been removed. The option
:cmakeop:`EXAMPLES_ENABLE_CUDA` enables all examples that use CUDA including the
RAJA examples with a CUDA back end (if RAJA is enabled).

Python is no longer required to run ``make test`` and ``make test_install``.

A bug was fixed where a nonlinear solver object could be freed twice in some use
cases.

Fixed a bug in :c:func:`ARKodeButcherTable_Write` when printing a Butcher table
without an embedding.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 4.0.2
====================================

Added information on how to contribute to SUNDIALS and a contributing agreement.

Moved the definitions of backwards compatibility functions for the prior direct
linear solver (DLS) and scaled preconditioned iterarive linear solvers (SPILS)
to a source file. The symbols are now included in the appropriate package
library, e.g. ``libsundials_cvode.lib``.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 4.0.1
====================================

A bug in ARKODE where single precision builds would fail to compile has been
fixed.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 4.0.0
====================================

The direct and iterative linear solver interfaces in all SUNDIALS packages have
been merged into a single unified linear solver interface to support any valid
:c:type:`SUNLinearSolver`. This includes the ``DIRECT`` and ``ITERATIVE`` types
as well as the new ``MATRIX_ITERATIVE`` type. Details regarding how SUNDIALS
packages utilize linear solvers of each type as well as a discussion regarding
the intended use cases for user-supplied linear solver implementations are
included in :numref:`SUNLinSol`. All example programs have been updated to use
the new unified linear solver interfaces.

The unified linear solver interface is very similar to the previous DLS (direct
linear solver) and SPILS (scaled preconditioned iterative linear solver)
interface in each package. To minimize challenges in user migration to the
unified linear solver interfaces, the previous DLS and SPILS functions may still
be used however, these are now deprecated and will be removed in a future
release. Additionally, that Fortran users will need to enlarge their array of
optional integer outputs, and update the indices that they query for certain
linear solver related statistics.

The names of all SUNDIALS-provided :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` constructors have
have been updated to follow the naming convention ``SUNLinSol_*`` where ``*`` is
the name of the linear solver. The new constructor names are:

* :c:func:`SUNLinSol_Band`
* :c:func:`SUNLinSol_Dense`
* :c:func:`SUNLinSol_KLU`
* :c:func:`SUNLinSol_LapackBand`
* :c:func:`SUNLinSol_LapackDense`
* :c:func:`SUNLinSol_PCG`
* :c:func:`SUNLinSol_SPBCGS`
* :c:func:`SUNLinSol_SPFGMR`
* :c:func:`SUNLinSol_SPGMR`
* :c:func:`SUNLinSol_SPTFQMR`
* :c:func:`SUNLinSol_SuperLUMT`

Linear solver-specific "set" routine names have been similarly standardized. To
minimize challenges in user migration to the new names, the previous function
names may still be used however, these are now deprecated and will be removed in
a future release. All example programs and the standalone linear solver examples
have been updated to use the new naming convention.

The :c:func:`SUNLinSol_Band` constructor has been simplified to remove the
storage upper bandwidth argument.

SUNDIALS integrators (ARKODE, CVODE(S), and IDA(S)) have been updated to utilize
generic nonlinear solvers defined by the :c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` API. This
enables the addition of new nonlinear solver options and allows for external or
user-supplied nonlinear solvers. The nonlinear solver API and SUNDIALS provided
implementations are described in :ref:`SUNNonlinSol` and follow the same
object oriented design used by the :c:type:`N_Vector`, :c:type:`SUNMatrix`, and
:c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` classes. Currently two nonlinear solver
implementations are provided, :ref:`Newton <SUNNonlinSol.Newton>` and
:ref:`fixed-point <SUNNonlinSol.FixedPoint>`. These replicate the previous
integrator-specific implementations of Newton's method and a fixed-point
iteration (previously referred to as a functional iteration), respectively. Note
the new :ref:`fixed-point <SUNNonlinSol.FixedPoint>` implementation can
optionally utilize Anderson's method to accelerate convergence. Example programs
using each of these nonlinear solvers in a standalone manner have been added and
all example programs have been updated accordingly.

The SUNDIALS integrators (ARKODE, CVODE(S), and IDA(S)) all now use the
:ref:`Newton <SUNNonlinSol.Newton>` :c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` by default.
Users that wish to use the :ref:`fixed-point <SUNNonlinSol.FixedPoint>`
:c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` will need to create the corresponding nonlinear
solver object and attach it to the integrator with the appropriate set function:

* :c:func:`ARKStepSetNonlinearSolver`
* :c:func:`CVodeSetNonlinearSolver`
* :c:func:`IDASetNonlinearSolver`

Functions for setting the nonlinear solver options or getting nonlinear solver
statistics remain unchanged and internally call generic ``SUNNonlinearSolver``
functions as needed.

With the introduction of the :c:type:`SUNNonlinearSolver` class, the input
parameter ``iter`` to :c:func:`CVodeCreate` has been removed along with the
function ``CVodeSetIterType`` and the constants ``CV_NEWTON`` and
``CV_FUNCTIONAL``. While SUNDIALS includes a fixed-point nonlinear solver, it is
not currently supported in IDA.

Three fused vector operations and seven vector array operations have been added
to the :c:type:`N_Vector` API. These *optional* operations are disabled by
default and may be activated by calling vector specific routines after creating
a vector (see :numref:`NVectors.Description` for more details). The new
operations are intended to increase data reuse in vector operations, reduce
parallel communication on distributed memory systems, and lower the number of
kernel launches on systems with accelerators. The fused operations are:

* :c:func:`N_VLinearCombination`
* :c:func:`N_VScaleAddMulti`
* :c:func:`N_VDotProdMulti`

and the vector array operations are:

* :c:func:`N_VLinearCombinationVectorArray`
* :c:func:`N_VScaleVectorArray`
* :c:func:`N_VConstVectorArray`
* :c:func:`N_VWrmsNormVectorArray`
* :c:func:`N_VWrmsNormMaskVectorArray`
* :c:func:`N_VScaleAddMultiVectorArray`
* :c:func:`N_VLinearCombinationVectorArray`

If an :c:type:`N_Vector` implementation defines the implementation any of these
operations as ``NULL``, then standard vector operations will automatically be
called as necessary to complete the computation.

A new :c:type:`N_Vector` implementation, :ref:`OpenMPDEV <NVectors.OpenMPDEV>`,
leveraging OpenMP device offloading has been added.

Multiple updates to the :ref:`CUDA <NVectors.CUDA>` vector were made:

* Changed the :c:func:`N_VMake_Cuda` function to take a host data pointer and a
  device data pointer instead of an ``N_VectorContent_Cuda`` object.

* Changed ``N_VGetLength_Cuda`` to return the global vector length instead
  of the local vector length.

* Added ``N_VGetLocalLength_Cuda`` to return the local vector length.

* Added ``N_VGetMPIComm_Cuda`` to return the MPI communicator used.

* Removed the accessor functions in the ``suncudavec`` namespace.

* Added the ability to set the ``cudaStream_t`` used for execution of the CUDA
  kernels. See the function ``N_VSetCudaStreams_Cuda``.

* Added :c:func:`N_VNewManaged_Cuda`, :c:func:`N_VMakeManaged_Cuda`, and
  :c:func:`N_VIsManagedMemory_Cuda` functions to accommodate using managed
  memory with the CUDA vector.

Multiple updates to the :ref:`RAJA <NVectors.RAJA>` vector were made:

* Changed ``N_VGetLength_Raja`` to return the global vector length instead
  of the local vector length.

* Added ``N_VGetLocalLength_Raja`` to return the local vector length.

* Added ``N_VGetMPIComm_Raja`` to return the MPI communicator used.

* Removed the accessor functions in the ``sunrajavec`` namespace.

Two changes were made in the ARKODE and CVODE(S) initial step size algorithm:

* Fixed an efficiency bug where an extra call to the RHS function was made.

* Changed the behavior of the algorithm if the max-iterations case is hit.
  Before the algorithm would exit with the step size calculated on the
  penultimate iteration. Now it will exit with the step size calculated
  on the final iteration.

Fortran 2003 interfaces to CVODE, the fixed-point and Newton nonlinear solvers,
the dense, band, KLU, PCG, SPBCGS, SPFGMR, SPGMR, and SPTFQMR linear solvers,
and the serial, PThreads, and OpenMP vectors have been added.

The ARKODE library has been entirely rewritten to support a modular approach to
one-step methods, which should allow rapid research and development of novel
integration methods without affecting existing solver functionality. To support
this, the existing ARK-based methods have been encapsulated inside the new
``ARKStep`` time-stepping module. Two new time-stepping modules have been added:

* The ``ERKStep`` module provides an optimized implementation for explicit
  Runge--Kutta methods with reduced storage and number of calls to the ODE
  right-hand side function.

* The ``MRIStep`` module implements two-rate explicit-explicit multirate
  infinitesimal step methods utilizing different step sizes for slow and fast
  processes in an additive splitting.

This restructure has resulted in numerous small changes to the user interface,
particularly the suite of "Set" routines for user-provided solver parameters and
"Get" routines to access solver statistics, that are now prefixed with the name
of time-stepping module (e.g., ``ARKStep`` or ``ERKStep``) instead of
``ARKODE``. Aside from affecting the names of these routines, user-level changes
have been kept to a minimum. However, we recommend that users consult both this
documentation and the ARKODE example programs for further details on the updated
infrastructure.

As part of the ARKODE restructuring an :c:type:`ARKodeButcherTable` structure
has been added for storing Butcher tables. Functions for creating new Butcher
tables and checking their analytic order are provided along with other utility
routines. For more details see the :ref:`ARKodeButcherTable` section.

ARKODE's dense output infrastructure has been improved to support higher-degree
Hermite polynomial interpolants (up to degree 5) over the last successful time
step.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 3.2.1
====================================

Fixed a bug in the :ref:`CUDA <NVectors.CUDA>` vector where the
:c:func:`N_VInvTest` operation could write beyond the allocated vector data.

Fixed the library installation path for multiarch systems. This fix changes the
default library installation path from ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib`` to
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR``. The default value library
directory name is automatically set to ``lib``, ``lib64``, or
``lib/<multiarch-tuple>`` depending on the system, but maybe be overridden by
setting :cmakeop:`CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR`.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 3.2.0
====================================

**Library Name Change**

Changed the name of the RAJA nvector library from ``libsundials_nvecraja.lib``
to ``libsundials_nveccudaraja.lib`` to better reflect that the RAJA vector only
support the CUDA backend currently.

**New Features**

Added hybrid MPI+CUDA and MPI+RAJA vectors to allow use of more than one MPI
rank when using a GPU system. The vectors assume one GPU device per MPI rank.

Support for optional inequality constraints on individual components of the
solution vector has been added to CVODE and CVODES. For more details see the
:ref:`CVODE.Mathematics` and :ref:`CVODE.Usage.CC.optional_input` sections.  Use
of :c:func:`CVodeSetConstraints` requires the :c:type:`N_Vector` operations
:c:func:`N_VMinQuotient`, :c:func:`N_VConstrMask`, and :c:func:`N_VCompare` that
were not previously required by CVODE and CVODES.

**CMake Updates**

CMake 3.1.3 is now the minimum required CMake version.

Deprecated the behavior of the :cmakeop:`SUNDIALS_INDEX_TYPE` CMake option and
added the :cmakeop:`SUNDIALS_INDEX_SIZE` CMake option to select the
:c:type:`sunindextype` integer size.

The native CMake FindMPI module is now used to locate an MPI installation.

If MPI is enabled and MPI compiler wrappers are not set, the build system will
check if ``CMAKE_<language>_COMPILER`` can compile MPI programs before trying
to locate and use an MPI installation.

The previous options for setting MPI compiler wrappers and the executable for
running MPI programs have been have been deprecated. The new options that align
with those used in native CMake FindMPI module are :cmakeop:`MPI_C_COMPILER`,
:cmakeop:`MPI_CXX_COMPILER`, :cmakeop:`MPI_Fortran_COMPILER`, and
:cmakeop:`MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE`.

When a Fortran name-mangling scheme is needed (e.g., :cmakeop:`ENABLE_LAPACK` is
``ON``) the build system will infer the scheme from the Fortran compiler. If a
Fortran compiler is not available or the inferred or default scheme needs to be
overridden, the advanced options ``SUNDIALS_F77_FUNC_CASE`` and
``SUNDIALS_F77_FUNC_UNDERSCORES`` can be used to manually set the name-mangling
scheme and bypass trying to infer the scheme.

Parts of the main ``CMakeLists.txt`` file were moved to new files in the ``src``
and ``example`` directories to make the CMake configuration file structure more
modular.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed a problem with setting :c:type:`sunindextype` which would occur with some
compilers (e.g. ``armclang``) that do not define ``__STDC_VERSION__``.

Fixed a thread-safety issue in CVODES and IDAS when using adjoint sensitivity
analysis.

Fixed a bug in IDAS where the saved residual value used in the nonlinear solve
for consistent initial conditions was passed as temporary workspace and could be
overwritten.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 3.1.2
====================================

**CMake Updates**

Updated the minimum required version of CMake to 2.8.12 and enabled using rpath
by default to locate shared libraries on OSX.

**New Features**

Added the function :c:func:`SUNSparseMatrix_Reallocate` to allow specification
of the matrix nonzero storage.

Added named constants for the two reinitialization types for the KLU
SUNLinearSolver.

Updated the :c:func:`SUNMatScaleAdd` and :c:func:`SUNMatScaleAddI`
implementations in the sparse SUNMatrix to more optimally handle the case where
the target matrix contained sufficient storage for the sum, but had the wrong
sparsity pattern. The sum now occurs in-place, by performing the sum backwards
in the existing storage. However, it is still more efficient if the
user-supplied Jacobian routine allocates storage for the sum
:math:`M + \gamma J` or :math:`M + \gamma J` manually (with zero entries if
needed).

The following examples from the usage notes page of the SUNDIALS website, and
updated them to work with SUNDIALS 3.x:

* ``cvDisc_dns.c`` demonstrates using CVODE with discontinuous solutions or RHS.

* ``cvRoberts_dns_negsol.c`` illustrates the use of the RHS function return
  value to control unphysical negative concentrations.

* ``cvRoberts_FSA_dns_Switch.c`` demonstrates switching on/off forward
  sensitivity computations. This example came from the usage notes page of the
  SUNDIALS website.

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed a Windows specific problem where :c:type:`sunindextype` was not correctly
defined when using 64-bit integers. On Windows :c:type:`sunindextype` is now
defined as the MSVC basic type ``__int64``.

Fixed a bug in the full KLU SUNLinearSolver reinitialization approach where the
sparse SUNMatrix pointer would go out of scope on some architectures.

The misnamed function ``CVSpilsSetJacTimesSetupFnBS`` has been deprecated and
replaced by ``CVSpilsSetJacTimesBS``. The deprecated function
``CVSpilsSetJacTimesSetupFnBS`` will be removed in the next major release.

Changed LICENSE install path to ``instdir/include/sundials``.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 3.1.1
====================================

**Bug Fixes**

Fixed a minor bug in the CVODE and CVODES ``cvSLdet``, where a return was
missing in the error check for three inconsistent roots.

Fixed a potential memory leak in the :ref:`SPGMR <SUNLinSol.SPGMR>` and
:ref:`SPFGMR <SUNLinSol.SPFGMR>` linear solvers. If "Initialize" was called
multiple times then the solver memory was reallocated (without being freed).

Fixed a minor bug in ``ARKReInit``, where a flag was incorrectly set to indicate
that the problem had been resized (instead of just re-initialized).

Fixed C++11 compiler errors/warnings about incompatible use of string literals.

Updated the KLU SUNLinearSolver to use a typedef for the precision-specific
solve functions to avoid compiler warnings.

Added missing typecasts for some (``void*``) pointers to avoid compiler
warnings.

Fixed bug in the sparse SUNMatrix where ``int`` was used instead of
``sunindextype`` in one location.

Fixed a minor bug in ``KINPrintInfo`` where a case was missing for
``KIN_REPTD_SYSFUNC_ERR`` leading to an undefined info message.

Added missing ``#include <stdio.h>`` in :c:type:`N_Vector` and
:c:type:`SUNMatrix` header files.

Added missing prototypes for ``ARKSpilsGetNumMTSetups`` in ARKODE and
``IDASpilsGetNumJTSetupEvals`` in IDA and IDAS.

Fixed an indexing bug in the CUDA vector implementation of
:c:func:`N_VWrmsNormMask` and revised the RAJA vector implementation of
:c:func:`N_VWrmsNormMask` to work with mask arrays using values other than zero
or one. Replaced ``double`` with ``realtype`` in the RAJA vector test functions.

Fixed compilation issue with GCC 7.3.0 and Fortran programs that do not require
a :c:type:`SUNMatrix` or :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` e.g., iterative linear
solvers, explicit methods in ARKODE, functional iteration in CVODE, etc.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 3.1.0
====================================

Added :c:type:`N_Vector` print functions that write vector data to a specified
file (e.g., :c:func:`N_VPrintFile_Serial`).

Added ``make test`` and ``make test_install`` options to the build system for
testing SUNDIALS after building with ``make`` and installing with ``make
install`` respectively.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 3.0.0
====================================

**Major Feature**

Added new linear solver and matrix interfaces for all SUNDIALS packages and
updated the existing linear solver and matrix implementations. The goal of the
redesign is to provide greater encapsulation and ease interfacing custom linear
solvers with linear solver libraries. Specific changes include:

* Added a :c:type:`SUNMatrix` interface with three provided implementations:
  dense, banded, and sparse. These replicate previous SUNDIALS direct (Dls) and
  sparse (Sls) matrix structures.

* Added example problems demonstrating use of the matrices.

* Added a :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` interface with eleven provided
  implementations: dense, banded, LAPACK dense, LAPACK band, KLU, SuperLU_MT,
  SPGMR, SPBCGS, SPTFQMR, SPFGMR, PCG. These replicate previous SUNDIALS generic
  linear solvers.

* Added example problems demonstrating use of the linear solvers.

* Expanded package-provided direct linear solver (Dls) interfaces and scaled,
  preconditioned, iterative linear solver (Spils) interfaces to utilize
  :c:type:`SUNMatrix` and :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` objects.

* Removed package-specific, linear solver-specific, solver modules (e.g.,
  CVDENSE, KINBAND, IDAKLU, ARKSPGMR) since their functionality is entirely
  replicated by the generic Dls/Spils interfaces and :c:type:`SUNLinearSolver` /
  :c:type:`SUNMatrix` classes. The exception is ``CVDIAG``, a diagonal
  approximate Jacobian solver available to CVODE and CVODES.

* Converted all SUNDIALS example problems to utilize new the new matrix and
  linear solver objects, along with updated Dls and Spils linear solver
  interfaces.

* Added Spils interface routines to ARKODE, CVODE, CVODES, IDA and IDAS to allow
  specification of a user-provided ``JTSetup`` routine. This change supports
  users who wish to set up data structures for the user-provided
  Jacobian-times-vector (``JTimes``) routine, and where the cost of one
  ``JTSetup`` setup per Newton iteration can be amortized between multiple
  ``JTimes`` calls.

Corresponding updates were made to all the example programs.

**New Features**

:ref:`CUDA <NVectors.CUDA>` and :ref:`RAJA <NVectors.RAJA>` :c:type:`N_Vector`
implementations to support GPU systems. These vectors are supplied to provide
very basic support for running on GPU architectures. Users are advised that
these vectors both move all data to the GPU device upon construction, and
speedup will only be realized if the user also conducts the right-hand-side
function evaluation on the device. In addition, these vectors assume the problem
fits on one GPU. For further information about RAJA, users are referred to the
`RAJA web site <https://software.llnl.gov/RAJA/>`_.

Added the type :c:type:`sunindextype` to support using 32-bit or 64-bit integer
types for indexing arrays within all SUNDIALS structures. :c:type:`sunindextype`
is defined to ``int32_t`` or ``int64_t`` when portable types are supported,
otherwise it is defined as ``int`` or ``long int``. The Fortran interfaces
continue to use ``long int`` for indices, except for the sparse matrix interface
that now uses :c:type:`sunindextype`. Interfaces to PETSc, hypre, SuperLU_MT,
and KLU have been updated with 32-bit or 64-bit capabilities depending how the
user configures SUNDIALS.

To avoid potential namespace conflicts, the macros defining
``booleantype`` values ``TRUE`` and ``FALSE`` have been changed to
:c:macro:`SUNTRUE` and :c:macro:`SUNFALSE` respectively.

Temporary vectors were removed from preconditioner setup and solve routines for
all packages. It is assumed that all necessary data for user-provided
preconditioner operations will be allocated and stored in user-provided data
structures.

The file ``include/sundials_fconfig.h`` was added. This file contains SUNDIALS
type information for use in Fortran programs.

Added support for many xSDK-compliant build system keys. For more information on
on xSDK compliance the `xSDK policies <https://xsdk.info/policies/>`_. The xSDK
is a movement in scientific software to provide a foundation for the rapid and
efficient production of high-quality, sustainable extreme-scale scientific
applications. For more information visit the
`xSDK web site <https://xsdk.info>`_.

Added functions :c:func:`SUNDIALSGetVersion` and
:c:func:`SUNDIALSGetVersionNumber` to get SUNDIALS release version information
at runtime.

Added comments to ``arkode_butcher.c`` regarding which methods should have
coefficients accurate enough for use in quad precision.

**Build System**

Renamed CMake options to enable/disable examples for greater clarity and added
option to enable/disable Fortran 77 examples:

  - Changed ``EXAMPLES_ENABLE`` to :cmakeop:`EXAMPLES_ENABLE_C`

  - Changed ``CXX_ENABLE`` to  :cmakeop:`EXAMPLES_ENABLE_CXX`

  - Changed ``F90_ENABLE`` to  ``EXAMPLES_ENABLE_F90``

  - Added ``EXAMPLES_ENABLE_F77`` option

Added separate ``BLAS_ENABLE`` and ``BLAS_LIBRARIES`` CMake variables.

Fixed minor CMake bugs and included additional error checking during CMake
configuration.

**Bug Fixes**

*ARKODE*

Fixed ``RCONST`` usage in ``arkode_butcher.c``.

Fixed bug in ``arkInitialSetup`` to ensure the mass matrix vector product is
set up before the "msetup" routine is called.

Fixed ARKODE ``printf``-related compiler warnings when building SUNDIALS
with extended precision.

*CVODE and CVODES*

:c:func:`CVodeFree` now calls ``lfree`` unconditionally (if non-NULL).

*IDA and IDAS*

Added missing prototype for :c:func:`IDASetMaxBacksIC` in ``ida.h`` and
``idas.h``.

*KINSOL*

Corrected KINSOL Fortran name translation for ``FKIN_SPFGMR``.

Renamed ``KINLocalFn`` and ``KINCommFn`` to :c:type:`KINBBDLocalFn` and
:c:type:`KINBBDCommFn` respectively in the BBD preconditioner module for
consistency with other SUNDIALS solvers.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 2.7.0
====================================

**New Features and Enhancements**

Two additional :c:type:`N_Vector` implementations were added -- one for
:ref:`hypre parallel vectors <NVectors.ParHyp>` and one for :ref:`PETSc
vectors <NVectors.NVPETSc>`. These additions are accompanied by additions to
various interface functions and to user documentation.

Added a new :c:type:`N_Vector` function, :c:func:`N_VGetVectorID`, that returns
an identifier for the vector.

The sparse matrix structure was enhanced to support both CSR and CSC matrix
storage formats.

Various additions were made to the KLU and SuperLU_MT sparse linear solver
interfaces, including support for the CSR matrix format when using KLU.

In all packages, the linear solver and preconditioner ``free`` routines were
updated to return an integer.

In all packages, example codes were updated to use ``N_VGetArrayPointer_*``
rather than the ``NV_DATA`` macro when using the native vectors shipped with
SUNDIALS.

Additional example programs were added throughout including new examples
utilizing the OpenMP vector.

*ARKODE*

The ARKODE implicit predictor algorithms were updated: methods 2 and 3 were
improved slightly, a new predictor approach was added, and the default choice
was modified.

The handling of integer codes for specifying built-in ARKODE Butcher tables was
enhanced. While a global numbering system is still used, methods now have
``#defined`` names to simplify the user interface and to streamline
incorporation of new Butcher tables into ARKODE.

The maximum number of Butcher table stages was increased from 8 to 15 to
accommodate very high order methods, and an 8th-order adaptive ERK method was
added.

Support was added for the explicit and implicit methods in an additive
Runge--Kutta method with different stage times to support new SSP-ARK methods.

The FARKODE interface was extended to include a routine to set
scalar/array-valued residual tolerances, to support Fortran applications with
non-identity mass-matrices.

*IDA and IDAS*

The optional input function :c:func:`IDASetMaxBacksIC` was added to set the
maximum number of linesearch backtracks in the initial condition calculation.

**Bug Fixes**

Various minor fixes to installation-related files.

Fixed some examples with respect to the change to use new macro/function names
e.g.,  ``SUNRexp``, etc.

In all packages, a memory leak was fixed in the banded preconditioner and
banded-block-diagonal preconditioner interfaces.

Corrected name ``N_VCloneEmptyVectorArray`` to ``N_VCloneVectorArrayEmpty`` in
all documentation files.

Various corrections were made to the interfaces to the sparse solvers KLU and
SuperLU_MT.

For each linear solver, the various solver performance counters are now
initialized to 0 in both the solver specification function and in the solver
``linit`` function. This ensures that these solver counters are initialized upon
linear solver instantiation as well as at the beginning of the problem solution.

*ARKODE*

The missing ``ARKSpilsGetNumMtimesEvals`` function was added -- this had been
included in the previous documentation but had not been implemented.

The choice of the method vs embedding the Billington and TRBDF2 explicit
Runge--Kutta methods were swapped, since in those the lower-order coefficients
result in an A-stable method, while the higher-order coefficients do not. This
change results in significantly improved robustness when using those methods.

A bug was fixed for the situation where a user supplies a vector of absolute
tolerances, and also uses the vector Resize functionality.

A bug was fixed wherein a user-supplied Butcher table without an embedding is
supplied, and the user is running with either fixed time steps (or they do
adaptivity manually); previously this had resulted in an error since the
embedding order was below 1.

*CVODE*

Corrections were made to three Fortran interface functions.

In FCVODE, fixed argument order bugs in the ``FCVKLU`` and ``FCVSUPERLUMT``
linear solver interfaces.

Added missing Fortran interface routines for supplying a sparse Jacobian routine
with sparse direct solvers.

*CVODES*

A bug was fixed in the interpolation functions used in solving backward problems
for adjoint sensitivity analysis.

In the interpolation routines for backward problems, added logic to bypass
sensitivity interpolation if input sensitivity argument is ``NULL``.

Changed each the return type of ``*FreeB`` functions to ``int`` and added
``return(0)`` to each.

*IDA*

Corrections were made to three Fortran interface functions.

Corrected the output from the ``idaFoodWeb_bnd.c`` example, the wrong component
was printed in ``PrintOutput``.

*IDAS*

In the interpolation routines for backward problems, added logic to bypass
sensitivity interpolation if input sensitivity argument is ``NULL``.

Changed each the return type of ``*FreeB`` functions to ``int`` and added
``return(0)`` to each.

Corrections were made to three Fortran interface functions.

Added missing Fortran interface routines for supplying a sparse Jacobian routine
with sparse direct solvers.

*KINSOL*

The Picard iteration return was chanegd to always return the newest iterate upon
success.

A minor bug in the line search was fixed to prevent an infinite loop when the
beta condition fails and lambda is below the minimum size.

Corrections were made to three Fortran interface functions.

The functions ``FKINCREATE`` and ``FKININIT`` were added to split the
``FKINMALLOC`` routine into two pieces. ``FKINMALLOC`` remains for backward
compatibility, but documentation for it has been removed.

Added missing Fortran interface routines for supplying a sparse Jacobian routine
with sparse direct solvers.

**Matlab Interfaces Removed**

Removed the Matlab interface from distribution as it has not been updated since
2009.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 2.6.2
====================================

**New Features and Enhancements**

Various minor fixes to installation-related files

In KINSOL and ARKODE, updated the Anderson acceleration implementation with QR
updating.

In CVODES and IDAS, added ``ReInit`` and ``SetOrdering`` wrappers for backward
problems.

In IDAS, fixed for-loop bugs in ``IDAAckpntAllocVectors`` that could lead to a
memory leak.

**Bug Fixes**

Updated the BiCGStab linear solver to remove a redundant dot product call.

Fixed potential memory leak in KLU ``ReInit`` functions in all solvers.

In ARKODE, fixed a bug in the Cash-Karp Butcher table where the method and
embedding coefficient were swapped.

In ARKODE, fixed error in ``arkDoErrorTest`` in recovery after failure.

In CVODES, added ``CVKLUB`` prototype and corrected ``CVSuperLUMTB`` prototype.

In the CVODES and IDAS header files, corrected documentation of backward
integration functions, especially the ``which`` argument.

In IDAS, added missing backward problem support functions ``IDALapackDenseB``,
``IDALapackDenseFreeB``, ``IDALapackBandB``, and ``IDALapackBandFreeB``.

In IDAS, made SuperLUMT call for backward problem consistent with CVODES.

In CVODE, IDA, and ARKODE, fixed Fortran interfaces to enable calls to
``GetErrWeights``, ``GetEstLocalErrors``, and ``GetDky`` within a time step.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 2.6.1
====================================

Fixed loop limit bug in ``SlsAddMat`` function.

In all six solver interfaces to KLU and SuperLUMT, added ``#include`` lines, and
removed redundant KLU structure allocations.

Minor bug fixes in ARKODE.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 2.6.0
====================================

**Autotools Build Option Removed**

With this version of SUNDIALS, support and documentation of the Autotools mode
of installation is being dropped, in favor of the CMake mode, which is
considered more widely portable.

**New Package: ARKODE**

Addition of ARKODE package of explicit, implicit, and additive Runge-Kutta
methods for ODEs. This package API is close to CVODE so switching between the
two should be straightforward. Thanks go to Daniel Reynolds for the addition
of this package.

**New Features and Enhancements**

Added :ref:`OpenMP <NVectors.OpenMP>` and :ref:`Pthreads <NVectors.Pthreads>`
:c:type:`N_Vector` implementations for thread-parallel computing environments.

Two major additions were made to the linear system solvers available in all
packages. First, in the serial case, an interface to the sparse direct solver
KLU was added. Second, an interface to SuperLU_MT, the multi-threaded version
of SuperLU, was added as a thread-parallel sparse direct solver option, to be
used with the serial version of the ``N_Vector`` module. As part of these
additions, a sparse matrix (CSC format) structure was added to CVODE.

*KINSOL*

Two major additions were made to the globalization strategy options (``KINSol``
argument ``strategy``). One is fixed-point iteration, and the other is Picard
iteration. Both can be accelerated by use of the Anderson acceleration
method. See the relevant paragraphs in Chapter :ref:`KINSOL.Mathematics`.

An interface to the Flexible GMRES iterative linear solver was added.

**Bug Fixes**

In order to avoid possible name conflicts, the mathematical macro and function
names ``MIN``, ``MAX``, ``SQR``, ``RAbs``, ``RSqrt``, ``RExp``, ``RPowerI``, and
``RPowerR`` were changed to ``SUNMIN``, ``SUNMAX``, ``SUNSQR``, ``SUNRabs``,
``SUNRsqrt``, ``SUNRexp``, ``SRpowerI``, and ``SUNRpowerR``, respectively. These
names occur in both the solver and example programs.

In the LAPACK banded linear solver interfaces, the line ``smu = MIN(N-1,mu+ml)``
was changed to ``smu = mu + ml`` to correct an illegal input error for to
``DGBTRF`` and ``DGBTRS``.

In all Fortran examples, integer declarations were revised so that those which
must match a C type ``long int`` are declared ``INTEGER*8``, and a comment was
added about the type match. All other integer declarations are just
``INTEGER``. Corresponding minor corrections were made to the user guide.

*CVODE and CVODES*

In ``cvRootFind``, a minor bug was corrected, where the input array was ignored,
and a line was added to break out of root-search loop if the initial interval
size is below the tolerance ``ttol``.

Two minor bugs were fixed regarding the testing of input on the first call to
``CVode`` -- one involving ``tstop`` and one involving the initialization of
``*tret``.

The example program ``cvAdvDiff_diag_p`` was added to illustrate the use of in
parallel.

In the FCVODE optional input routines ``FCVSETIIN`` and ``FCVSETRIN``, the
optional fourth argument ``key_length`` was removed, with hardcoded key string
lengths passed to all tests.

In order to eliminate or minimize the differences between the sources for
private functions in CVODE and CVODES, the names of many private functions were
changed from ``CV*`` to ``cv*`` and a few other names were also changed.

An option was added in the case of Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis with dense or
banded Jacobian. With a call to ``CVDlsSetDenseJacFnBS`` or
``CVDlsSetBandJacFnBS``, the user can specify a user-supplied Jacobian function
of type ``CVDls***JacFnBS``, for the case where the backward problem depends on
the forward sensitivities.

In ``CVodeQuadSensInit``, the line ``cv_mem->cv_fQS_data = ...`` was corrected
(missing ``Q``).

In the CVODES User Guide, a paragraph was added in Section 6.2.1 on
``CVodeAdjReInit``, and a paragraph was added in Section 6.2.9 on
``CVodeGetAdjY``. In the example ``cvsRoberts_ASAi_dns``, the output was revised
to include the use of ``CVodeGetAdjY``.

For the Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis case in which the backward problem depends
on the forward sensitivities, options have been added to allow for user-supplied
``pset``, ``psolve``, and ``jtimes`` functions.

In the example ``cvsHessian_ASA_FSA``, an error was corrected in the function
``fB2``, ``y2`` in place of ``y3`` in the third term of ``Ith(yBdot,6)``.

*IDA and IDAS*

In ``IDARootfind``, a minor bug was corrected, where the input array ``rootdir``
was ignored, and a line was added to break out of root-search loop if the
initial interval size is below the tolerance ``ttol``.

A minor bug was fixed regarding the testing of the input ``tstop`` on the first
call to :c:func:`IDASolve`.

In the FIDA optional input routines ``FIDASETIIN``, ``FIDASETRIN``, and
``FIDASETVIN``, the optional fourth argument ``key_length`` was removed, with
hardcoded key string lengths passed to all ``strncmp`` tests.

An option was added in the case of Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis with dense or
banded Jacobian. With a call to ``IDADlsSetDenseJacFnBS`` or
``IDADlsSetBandJacFnBS``, the user can specify a user-supplied Jacobian function
of type ``IDADls***JacFnBS``, for the case where the backward problem depends on
the forward sensitivities.

*KINSOL*

In function ``KINStop``, two return values were corrected to make the values of
``uu`` and ``fval`` consistent.

A bug involving initialization of ``mxnewtstep`` was fixed. The error affects
the case of repeated user calls to ``KINSol`` with no intervening call to
``KINSetMaxNewtonStep``.

A bug in the increments for difference quotient Jacobian approximations was
fixed in function ``kinDlsBandDQJac``.

In the FKINSOL module, an incorrect return value ``ier`` in ``FKINfunc`` was
fixed.

In the FKINSOL optional input routines ``FKINSETIIN``, ``FKINSETRIN``, and
``FKINSETVIN``, the optional fourth argument ``key_length`` was removed, with
hardcoded key string lengths passed to all ``strncmp`` tests.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 2.5.0
====================================

**Integer Type Change**

One significant design change was made with this release, the problem size and
its relatives, bandwidth parameters, related internal indices, pivot arrays, and
the optional output ``lsflag`` have all been changed from type ``int`` to type
``long int``, except for the problem size and bandwidths in user calls to
routines specifying BLAS/LAPACK routines for the dense/band linear solvers. The
function ``NewIntArray`` is replaced by a pair ``NewIntArray`` /
``NewLintArray``, for ``int`` and ``long int`` arrays, respectively.

**Bug Fixes**

In the installation files, we modified the treatment of the macro
``SUNDIALS_USE_GENERIC_MATH``, so that the parameter ``GENERIC_MATH_LIB`` is
either defined (with no value) or not defined.

In all packages, after the solver memory is created, it is set to zero before
being filled.

In each linear solver interface function, the linear solver memory is freed on
an error return, and the function now includes a line setting to ``NULL`` the
main memory pointer to the linear solver memory.

*Rootfinding*

In CVODE(S) and IDA(S), in the functions ``Rcheck1`` and ``Rcheck2``, when an
exact zero is found, the array ``glo`` of :math:`g` values at the left endpoint
is adjusted, instead of shifting the :math:`t` location ``tlo`` slightly.

*CVODE and CVODES*

In ``CVSetTqBDF``, the logic was changed to avoid a divide by zero.

In a minor change to the CVODES user interface, the type of the index ``which``
was changed from ``long int`` to ``int``.

Errors in the logic for the integration of backward problems in CVODES were
identified and fixed.

*IDA and IDAS*

To be consistent with IDAS, IDA uses the function ``IDAGetDky`` for optional
output retrieval.

A memory leak was fixed in two of the ``IDASp***Free`` functions.

A missing vector pointer setting was added in ``IDASensLineSrch``.

In ``IDACompleteStep``, conditionals around lines loading a new column of three
auxiliary divided difference arrays, for a possible order increase, were fixed.

*KINSOL*

Three major logic bugs were fixed - involving updating the solution vector,
updating the linesearch parameter, and a missing error return.

Three minor errors were fixed - involving setting ``etachoice`` in the
Matlab/KINSOL interface, a missing error case in ``KINPrintInfo``, and avoiding
an exponential overflow in the evaluation of ``omega``.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 2.4.0
====================================

Added a CMake-based build option in addition to the one based on autotools.

The user interface has been further refined. Some of the API changes involve:

(a) a reorganization of all linear solver modules into two families (besides the
    existing family of scaled preconditioned iterative linear solvers, the
    direct solvers, including new LAPACK-based ones, were also organized into a
    *direct* family);

(b) maintaining a single pointer to user data, optionally specified through a
    ``Set``-type function; and

(c) a general streamlining of the preconditioner modules distributed with the
    solvers.

Added interfaces to LAPACK linear solvers for dense and banded matrices to all
packages.

An option was added to specify which direction of zero-crossing is to be
monitored while performing rootfinding in CVODE(S) and IDA(S).

CVODES includes several new features related to sensitivity analysis, among
which are:

(a) support for integration of quadrature equations depending on both the states
    and forward sensitivity (and thus support for forward sensitivity analysis
    of quadrature equations),

(b) support for simultaneous integration of multiple backward problems based on
    the same underlying ODE (e.g., for use in an *forward-over-adjoint* method
    for computing second order derivative information),

(c) support for backward integration of ODEs and quadratures depending on both
    forward states and sensitivities (e.g., for use in computing second-order
    derivative information), and

(d) support for reinitialization of the adjoint module.

Moreover, the prototypes of all functions related to integration of backward
problems were modified to support the simultaneous integration of multiple
problems.

All backward problems defined by the user are internally managed through a
linked list and identified in the user interface through a unique identifier.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 2.3.0
====================================

**New Features and Enhancements**

The main changes in this release involve a rearrangement of the entire
SUNDIALS source tree. At the user interface level, the main impact is in the
mechanism of including SUNDIALS header files which must now include the relative
path e.g., ``#include <cvode/cvode.h>`` as all exported header files are now
installed in separate subdirectories of the installation *include* directory.

The functions in the generic dense linear solver (``sundials_dense`` and
``sundials_smalldense``) were modified to work for rectangular :math:`m \times
n` matrices (:math:`m \le n`), while the factorization and solution functions
were renamed to ``DenseGETRF`` / ``denGETRF`` and ``DenseGETRS`` / ``denGETRS``,
respectively. The factorization and solution functions in the generic band
linear solver were renamed ``BandGBTRF`` and ``BandGBTRS``, respectively.

In IDA, the user interface to the consistent initial conditions calculations was
modified. The :c:func:`IDACalcIC` arguments ``t0``, ``yy0``, and ``yp0`` were
removed and a new function, :c:func:`IDAGetConsistentIC` is provided.

**Bug Fixes**

In the CVODES adjoint solver module, the following two bugs were fixed:

* In ``CVodeF`` the solver was sometimes incorrectly taking an additional step
  before returning control to the user (in ``CV_NORMAL`` mode) thus leading to
  a failure in the interpolated output function.

* In ``CVodeB``, while searching for the current check point, the solver was
  sometimes reaching outside the integration interval resulting in a
  segmentation fault.

In IDA, a bug was fixed in the internal difference-quotient dense and banded
Jacobian approximations, related to the estimation of the perturbation (which
could have led to a failure of the linear solver when zero components with
sufficiently small absolute tolerances were present).

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 2.2.0
====================================

**New Header Files Names**

To reduce the possibility of conflicts, the names of all header files have been
changed by adding unique prefixes (e.g., ``cvode_`` and ``sundials_``). When
using the default installation procedure, the header files are exported under
various subdirectories of the target ``include`` directory. For more details see
Appendix :numref:`Installation`.

**Build System Changes**

Updated configure script and Makefiles for Fortran examples to avoid C++
compiler errors (now use ``CC`` and ``MPICC`` to link only if necessary).

The shared object files are now linked into each SUNDIALS library rater than
into a separate ``libsundials_shared`` library.

**New Features and Enhancements**

Deallocation functions now take the address of the respective memory block
pointer as the input argument.

Interfaces to the Scaled Preconditioned Bi-CGstab (SPBCG) and Scaled
Preconditioned Transpose-Free Quasi-Minimal Residual (SPTFQMR) linear solver
modules have been added to all packages. At the same time, function type names
for Scaled Preconditioned Iterative Linear Solvers were added for the
user-supplied Jacobian-times-vector and preconditioner setup and solve
functions. Additionally, in KINSOL interfaces have been added to the SUNDIALS
DENSE, and BAND linear solvers and include support for nonlinear residual
monitoring which can be used to control Jacobian updating.

A new interpolation method was added to the CVODES adjoint module. The function
``CVadjMalloc`` has an additional argument which can be used to select the
desired interpolation scheme.

FIDA, a Fortran-C interface module, was added.

The rootfinding feature was added to IDA, whereby the roots of a set of given
functions may be computed during the integration of the DAE system.

In IDA a user-callable routine was added to access the estimated local error
vector.

In the KINSOL Fortran interface module, FKINSOL, optional inputs are now set
using ``FKINSETIIN`` (integer inputs), ``FKINSETRIN`` (real inputs), and
``FKINSETVIN`` (vector inputs). Optional outputs are still obtained from the
``IOUT`` and ``ROUT`` arrays which are owned by the user and passed as arguments
to ``FKINMALLOC``.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 2.1.1
====================================

The function ``N_VCloneEmpty`` was added to the global vector operations table.

A minor bug was fixed in the interpolation functions of the adjoint CVODES
module.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 2.1.0
====================================

The user interface has been further refined. Several functions used for setting
optional inputs were combined into a single one.

In CVODE(S) and IDA, an optional user-supplied routine for setting the error
weight vector was added.

Additionally, to resolve potential variable scope issues, all SUNDIALS solvers
release user data right after its use.

The build systems has been further improved to make it more robust.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 2.0.2
====================================

Fixed autoconf-related bug to allow configuration with the PGI Fortran compiler.

Modified the build system to use customized detection of the Fortran name
mangling scheme (autoconf's ``AC_F77_WRAPPERS`` routine is problematic on some
platforms).

A bug was fixed in the ``CVode`` function that was potentially leading to
erroneous behavior of the rootfinding procedure on the integration first step.

A new chapter in the User Guide was added - with constants that appear in the
user interface.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 2.0.1
====================================

**Build System**

Changed the order of compiler directives in header files to avoid compilation
errors when using a C++ compiler.

Changed the method of generating ``sundials_config.h`` to avoid potential
warnings of redefinition of preprocessor symbols.

**New Features**

In CVODES the option of activating and deactivating forward sensitivity
calculations on successive runs without memory allocation and deallocation.

**Bug Fixes**

In CVODES bug fixes related to forward sensitivity computations (possible loss
of accuracy on a BDF order increase and incorrect logic in testing user-supplied
absolute tolerances) were made.

Changes to SUNDIALS in release 2.0.0
====================================

Installation of all of SUNDIALS packages has been completely redesigned and is
now based on configure scripts.

The major changes from the previous version involve a redesign of the user
interface across the entire SUNDIALS suite. We have eliminated the mechanism of
providing optional inputs and extracting optional statistics from the solver
through the ``iopt`` and ``ropt`` arrays. Instead, packages now provide ``Set``
functions to change the default values for various quantities controlling the
solver and ``Get`` functions to extract statistics after return from the main
solver routine.

Additionally, the interfaces to several user-supplied routines (such as those
providing Jacobians and preconditioner information) were simplified by reducing
the number of arguments. The same information that was previously accessible
through such arguments can now be obtained through ``Get``-type functions.

In CVODE and CVODES a rootfinding feature was added, whereby the roots of a set
of given functions may be computed during the integration of the ODE system.

Changes to the NVector:

* Removed ``machEnv``, redefined table of vector operations (now contained in
  the :c:type:`N_Vector` structure itself).

* All SUNDIALS functions create new :c:type:`N_Vector` variables through
  cloning, using an :c:type:`N_Vector` passed by the user as a template.

* A particular vector implementation is supposed to provide user-callable
  constructor and destructor functions.

* Removed the following functions from the structure of vector operations:
  ``N_VNew``, ``N_VNew_S``, ``N_VFree``, ``N_VFree_S``, ``N_VMake``,
  ``N_VDispose``, ``N_VGetData``, ``N_VSetData``, ``N_VConstrProdPos``, and
  ``N_VOneMask``.

* Added the following functions to the structure of vector operations:
  ``N_VClone``, ``N_VDestroy``, ``N_VSpace``, ``N_VGetArrayPointer``,
  ``N_VSetArrayPointer``, and ``N_VWrmsNormMask``.

* Note that ``nvec_ser`` and ``nvec_par`` are now separate modules outside the
  shared SUNDIALS module.

Changes to the linear solvers:

* In SPGMR, added a dummy ``N_Vector`` argument to be used as a template for
  cloning.

* In SPGMR, removed ``N`` (problem dimension) from the argument list of
  ``SpgmrMalloc``.

* Replaced ``iterativ.{c,h}`` with ``iterative.{c,h}``.

* Modified constant names in ``iterative.h`` (preconditioner types are prefixed
  with ``PREC_``).

* Changed numerical values for ``MODIFIED_GS`` (from ``0`` to ``1``) and
  ``CLASSICAL_GS`` (from ``1`` to ``2``).

Changes to ``sundialsmath`` submodule:

* Replaced the internal routine for estimating unit roundoff with definition of
  unit roundoff from ``float.h``.

* Modified functions to call the appropriate math routines given the precision
  level specified by the user.

Changes to ``sundialstypes`` submodule:

* Removed ``integertype``.

* Added definitions for ``BIG_REAL``, ``SMALL_REAL``, and ``UNIT_ROUNDOFF``
  using values from ``float.h`` based on the precision.

* Changed definition of macro ``RCONST`` to depend on the precision level
  specified by the user.
