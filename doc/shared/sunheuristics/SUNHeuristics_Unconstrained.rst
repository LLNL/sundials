.. _SUNHeuristics.Unconstrained:

The SUNHeuristics_Unconstrained Module
======================================

We provide an "unconstrained" implementation of the SUNHeuristics class, SUNHeuristics_Unconstrained.  While this object may indeed be called by integrators, it implements essentially no heuristics constraints on the step size.

This is implemented as a derived SUNHeuristics class, and defines its *content* field as:

.. code-block:: c

   struct _SUNHeuristicsContent_Unconstrained {
     long int nst_acc;
   };

Note that the only entry in the *content* field is a counter, that keeps track of the number of calls made to its :c:func:`SUNHeuristicsConstrainStep` routine.  Since this class implements essentially no heuristic time step control, it relies on the base class implementation for most of the operations from :numref:`SUNHeuristics.Description.operations`, with a few notable exceptions.

* It self-identifies as having :c:type:`SUNHeuristics_ID` type as ``SUNDIALS_HEURISTICS_NULL``.

* At each call to :c:func:`SUNHeuristicsConstrainStep` it updates the ``nst_acc`` counter and sets the "constrained" step to be the same value as what was requested.

* Its :c:func:`SUNHeuristicsConvFail` routine does not adjust the input step size, and returns the failure code ``SUNHEURISTICS_CANNOT_DECREASE``.

* Its :c:func:`SUNHeuristicsReset` routine resets ``nst_acc`` to zero.

* Its :c:func:`SUNHeuristicsWrite`, :c:func:`SUNHeuristicsGetNumAccSteps` and :c:func:`SUNHeuristicsSpace` routines perform as expected, given the class' storage of the ``nst_acc`` counter.

The header file to be included when using this module is
``sunheuristics/sunheuristics_unconstrained.h``.

In addition to the routines mentioned above, the SUNHeuristics_Unconstrained class provides the following constructor routine:

.. c:function:: SUNHeuristics SUNHeuristicsUnconstrained(SUNContext sunctx)

   This constructor function creates and allocates memory for a SUNHeuristics_Unconstrained object, and initializes its ``nst_acc`` counter to zero.  The only argument is the SUNDIALS context object.  Upon successful completion it will return a :c:type:`SUNHeuristics` object; otherwise it will return ``NULL``.
