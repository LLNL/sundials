All SUNDIALS packages are released open source, under the BSD 3-Clause
license. The only requirements of the license are preservation of copyright and
a standard disclaimer of liability. The full text of the license and an
additional notice are provided below and may also be found in the LICENSE and
NOTICE files provided with all SUNDIALS packages.

.. note::

   If you are using SUNDIALS with any third party libraries linked in (e.g.,
   LAPACK, KLU, SuperLU_MT, PETSc, or *hypre*), be sure to review the respective
   license of the package as that license may have more restrictive terms than
   the SUNDIALS license.  For example, if someone builds SUNDIALS with a
   statically linked KLU, the build is subject to terms of the more-restrictive
   LGPL license (which is what KLU is released with) and *not* the SUNDIALS BSD
   license anymore.
