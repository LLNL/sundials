\section{The SUNLinearSolver\_Band implementation}
\label{ss:sunlinsol_band}
% ====================================================================

This section describes the {\sunlinsol} implementation for solving banded linear
systems. The {\sunlinsolband} module is designed to be used with the
corresponding {\sunmatband} matrix type, and one of the serial or
shared-memory {\nvector} implementations ({\nvecs}, {\nvecopenmp}, or
{\nvecpthreads}).

To access the {\sunlinsolband} module, include the header file
\id{sunlinsol/sunlinsol\_band.h}. We note that the {\sunlinsolband} module is
accessible from {\sundials} packages \textit{without} separately linking to
the \id{libsundials\_sunlinsolband} module library.


% ====================================================================
\subsection{SUNLinearSolver\_Band description}
\label{ss:sunlinsol_band_description}
% ====================================================================

This solver is constructed to perform the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
\item The ``setup'' call performs a $LU$ factorization with
  partial (row) pivoting, $PA=LU$, where $P$ is a permutation matrix,
  $L$ is a lower triangular matrix with 1's on the diagonal, and $U$
  is an upper triangular matrix.  This factorization is stored
  in-place on the input {\sunmatband} object $A$, with pivoting
  information encoding $P$ stored in the \id{pivots} array.
\item The ``solve'' call performs pivoting and forward and
  backward substitution using the stored \id{pivots} array and the
  $LU$ factors held in the {\sunmatband} object.
\item
  $A$ must be allocated to accommodate the increase in upper
  bandwidth that occurs during factorization.  More precisely, if $A$
  is a band matrix with upper bandwidth \id{mu} and lower bandwidth
  \id{ml}, then the upper triangular factor $U$ can have upper
  bandwidth as big as \id{smu = MIN(N-1,mu+ml)}. The lower triangular
  factor $L$ has lower bandwidth \id{ml}. {\warn}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SUNLinearSolver\_Band functions}
\label{ss:sunlinsol_band_functions}
% ====================================================================

The {\sunlinsolband} module provides the following user-callable constructor
for creating a \newline \id{SUNLinearSolver} object.
%
% --------------------------------------------------------------------
%
\ucfunctiondf{SUNLinSol\_Band}
{
  LS = SUNLinSol\_Band(y, A);
}
{
  The function \ID{SUNLinSol\_Band} creates and allocates memory for
  a band \newline \id{SUNLinearSolver} object.
}
{
  \begin{args}[y]
  \item[y] (\id{N\_Vector})
    a template for cloning vectors needed within the solver
  \item[A] (\id{SUNMatrix})
    a {\sunmatband} matrix template for cloning matrices needed
    within the solver 
  \end{args}
}
{
  This returns a \id{SUNLinearSolver} object.  If either \id{A} or
  \id{y} are incompatible then this routine will return \id{NULL}.
}
{
  This routine will perform consistency checks to ensure that it is
  called with consistent {\nvector} and {\sunmatrix} implementations.
  These are currently limited to the {\sunmatband} matrix type and
  the {\nvecs}, {\nvecopenmp}, and {\nvecpthreads} vector types.  As
  additional compatible matrix and vector implementations are added to
  {\sundials}, these will be included within this compatibility check.

  Additionally, this routine will verify that the input matrix \id{A}
  is allocated with appropriate upper bandwidth storage for the $LU$
  factorization.
}

% --------------------------------------------------------------------
%
The {\sunlinsolband} module defines band implementations of all
``direct'' linear solver operations listed in Sections
\ref{ss:sunlinsol_CoreFn} -- \ref{ss:sunlinsol_GetFn}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \id{SUNLinSolGetType\_Band}
\item \id{SUNLinSolInitialize\_Band} -- this does nothing, since all
  consistency checks are performed at solver creation.
\item \id{SUNLinSolSetup\_Band} -- this performs the $LU$ factorization.
\item \id{SUNLinSolSolve\_Band} -- this uses the $LU$ factors
  and \id{pivots} array to perform the solve.
\item \id{SUNLinSolLastFlag\_Band}
\item \id{SUNLinSolSpace\_Band} -- this only returns information for
  the storage \emph{within} the solver object, i.e.~storage
  for \id{N}, \id{last\_flag}, and \id{pivots}.
\item \id{SUNLinSolFree\_Band}
\end{itemize}
All of the listed operations are callable via the {\F} 2003 interface module
by prepending an `F' to the function name.

\subsection{SUNLinearSolver\_Band Fortran interfaces}
\label{ss:sunlinsol_band_fortran}
% ====================================================================

The {\sunlinsolband} module provides a {\F} 2003 module as well as {\F} 77
style interface functions for use from {\F} applications.

\subsubsection*{FORTRAN 2003 interface module}
The \ID{fsunlinsol\_band\_mod} {\F} module defines interfaces to all
{\sunlinsolband} {\CC} functions using the intrinsic \id{iso\_c\_binding}
module which provides a standardized mechanism for interoperating with {\CC}. As
noted in the {\CC} function descriptions above, the interface functions are
named after the corresponding {\CC} function, but with a leading `F'. For
example, the function \id{SUNLinSol\_Band} is interfaced as
\id{FSUNLinSol\_Band}.

The {\F} 2003 {\sunlinsolband} interface module can be accessed with the \id{use}
statement, i.e. \id{use fsunlinsol\_band\_mod}, and linking to the library
\id{libsundials\_fsunlinsolband\_mod}.{\em lib} in addition to the {\CC} library.
For details on where the library and module file
\id{fsunlinsol\_band\_mod.mod} are installed see Appendix \ref{c:install}.
We note that the module is accessible from the {\F} 2003 {\sundials} integrators
\textit{without} separately linking to the
\id{libsundials\_fsunlinsolband\_mod} library.

\subsubsection*{FORTRAN 77 interface functions}
For solvers that include a {\F} 77 interface module, the {\sunlinsolband}
module also includes a Fortran-callable function for creating a
\id{SUNLinearSolver} object.
%
% --------------------------------------------------------------------
%
\ucfunction{FSUNBANDLINSOLINIT}
{
  FSUNBANDLINSOLINIT(code, ier)
}
{
  The function \ID{FSUNBANDLINSOLINIT} can be called for Fortran programs
  to create a band \id{SUNLinearSolver} object.
}
{
  \begin{args}[code]
  \item[code] (\id{int*})
    is an integer input specifying the solver id (1 for {\cvode}, 2
    for {\ida}, 3 for {\kinsol}, and 4 for {\arkode}).
  \end{args}
}
{
  \id{ier} is a return completion flag equal to \id{0} for a success
  return and \id{-1} otherwise. See printed message for details in case
  of failure.
}
{
  This routine must be
  called \emph{after} both the {\nvector} and {\sunmatrix} objects have
  been initialized.
}
Additionally, when using {\arkode} with a non-identity
mass matrix, the {\sunlinsolband} module includes a Fortran-callable
function for creating a \id{SUNLinearSolver} mass matrix solver
object.
%
% --------------------------------------------------------------------
%
\ucfunction{FSUNMASSBANDLINSOLINIT}
{
  FSUNMASSBANDLINSOLINIT(ier)
}
{
  The function \ID{FSUNMASSBANDLINSOLINIT} can be called for Fortran programs
  to create a band \id{SUNLinearSolver} object for mass matrix linear
  systems.
}
{}
{
  \id{ier} is a \id{int} return completion flag equal to \id{0} for a success
  return and \id{-1} otherwise. See printed message for details in case
  of failure.
}
{
  This routine must be
  called \emph{after} both the {\nvector} and {\sunmatrix} mass-matrix
  objects have been initialized.
}


% ====================================================================
\subsection{SUNLinearSolver\_Band content}
\label{ss:sunlinsol_band_content}
% ====================================================================

The {\sunlinsolband} module defines the \textit{content} field of a
\id{SUNLinearSolver} as the following structure:
%%
\begin{verbatim} 
struct _SUNLinearSolverContent_Band {
  sunindextype N;
  sunindextype *pivots;
  long int last_flag;
};
\end{verbatim}
%%
These entries of the \emph{content} field contain the following
information:
\begin{args}[last\_flag]
  \item[N] - size of the linear system,
  \item[pivots] - index array for partial pivoting in LU factorization,
  \item[last\_flag] - last error return flag from internal function evaluations.
\end{args}
