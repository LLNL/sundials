   The CVODES examples documentation is intended to serve as a companion
   document to the CVODES User Documentation. These example programs demonstrate
   a large variety (but not exhaustive set) of CVODES options and can be used as
   templates for new problems. Further information on the CVODES package itself
   may be found in the CVODES user guide.
