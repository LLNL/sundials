# SUNDIALS Documentation

The SUNDIALS documentation is written using reStructuredText and
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

To build the documentation with Sphinx you will need Python 3.9+. Sphinx and the
necessary extensions can be installed using the requirements file i.e.,
`pip install -r requirements.txt`. Additionally, building the developer
documentation requires [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) for generating
flowcharts.
