ARKODE organization
===================

The ARKODE package is written in the ANSI C language.  The
following summarizes the basic structure of the package, although
knowledge of this structure is not necessary for its use.

The overall organization of the ARKODE package is shown in
:numref:`ARKODE.Organization.ARKODE.Figure`.  The central integration modules,
implemented in the files ``arkode.h``, ``arkode_impl.h``, ``arkode_butcher.h``,
``arkode.c``, ``arkode_arkstep.c`` , ``arkode_erkstep.c``, ``arkode_mristep.h``,
and ``arkode_butcher.c``, deal with the evaluation of integration stages, the
nonlinear solvers, estimation of the local truncation error, selection of step
size, and interpolation to user output points, among other issues.  ARKODE
supports SUNNonlinearSolver modules in either root-finding or fixed-point form
(see section :numref:`SUNNonlinSol`) for any nonlinearly implicit problems that
arise in computing each internal stage. When using Newton-based nonlinear
solvers, or when using a non-identity mass matrix :math:`M\ne I`, ARKODE has
flexibility in the choice of method used to solve the linear sub-systems that
arise.  Therefore, for any user problem invoking the Newton solvers, or any user
problem with :math:`M\ne I`, one (or more) of the linear system solver modules
should be specified by the user; this/these are then invoked as needed during
the integration process.

   *ARKODE organization*: Overall structure of the ARKODE package.
   Modules specific to ARKODE are the timesteppers (ARKODE), linear solver
   interfaces (ARKLS), nonlinear solver interfaces (ARKNLS), and preconditioners
   (ARKBANDPRE and ARKBBDPRE); all other items correspond to generic SUNDIALS
   vector, matrix, and solver modules.

For solving these linear systems, ARKODE's linear solver interface
supports both direct and iterative linear solvers adhering to the
generic SUNLINSOL API (see :numref:`SUNLinSol`).  These solvers may
utilize a SUNMATRIX object for storing Jacobian information, or they
may be matrix-free.  Since ARKODE can operate on any valid SUNLINSOL
implementation, the set of linear solver modules available to ARKODE
will expand as new SUNLINSOL modules are developed.

For preconditioned iterative methods with either the system or mass
matrix solves, the preconditioning must be supplied by the user
in two phases: setup and solve.  While there is no default choice of
preconditioner for generic problems, the references :cite:p:`BrHi:89`
and :cite:p:`Byr:92`, together with the example and demonstration
programs included with ARKODE and CVODE, offer considerable
assistance in building simple preconditioners.

ARKODE also provides two rudimentary preconditioner modules, for
use with any of the Krylov iterative linear solvers.  The first,
ARKBANDPRE is intended to be used with the serial or threaded vector
data structures (NVECTOR_SERIAL, NVECTOR_OPENMP and NVECTOR_PTHREADS),
and provides a banded difference-quotient approximation to the
Jacobian as the preconditioner, with corresponding setup and solve
routines.  The second preconditioner module, ARKBBDPRE, is intended to
work with the parallel vector data structure, NVECTOR_PARALLEL, and
generates a preconditioner that is a block-diagonal matrix with each
block being a band matrix owned by a single processor.

All state information used by ARKODE to solve a given problem is
saved in a single opaque memory structure, and a pointer to that
structure is returned to the user.  For C, C++ and Fortran 2003
applications there is no global data in the ARKODE package, and so in
this respect it is reentrant.  State information specific to the
linear solver interface is saved in a separate data structure, a
pointer to which resides in the ARKODE memory structure.  State
information specific to the linear solver implementation (and matrix
implementation, if applicable) are stored in their own data
structures, that are returned to the user upon construction, and
subsequently provided to ARKODE for use.
