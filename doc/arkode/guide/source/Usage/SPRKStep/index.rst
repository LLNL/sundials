.. _ARKODE.Usage.SPRKStep:

==========================================
Using the SPRKStep time-stepping module
==========================================

This section is concerned with the use of the SPRKStep time-stepping
module for the solution of initial value problems (IVPs) in a C or C++
language setting.  Usage of SPRKStep follows that of the rest of ARKODE,
and so in this section we primarily focus on those usage aspects that
are specific to SPRKStep.

We note that of the ARKODE example programs located in the source code
``examples/arkode`` folder, the following demonstrate ``SPRKStep`` usage:

* ``examples/arkode/C_serial/ark_harmonic_symplectic.c``
* ``examples/arkode/C_serial/ark_damped_harmonic_symplectic.c``, and
* ``examples/arkode/C_serial/ark_kepler.c``
