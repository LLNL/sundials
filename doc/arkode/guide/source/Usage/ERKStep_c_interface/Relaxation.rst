Relaxation Methods
==================

This section describes user-callable functions for applying relaxation methods
with ERKStep. For more information on relaxation Runge--Kutta methods see
:numref:`ARKODE.Mathematics.Relaxation`.

Enabling or Disabling Relaxation
--------------------------------

.. c:function:: int ERKStepSetRelaxFn(void* arkode_mem, ARKRelaxFn rfn, ARKRelaxJacFn rjac)

   Attaches the user supplied functions for evaluating the relaxation function
   (``rfn``) and its Jacobian (``rjac``).

   Both ``rfn`` and ``rjac`` are required and an error will be returned if only
   one of the functions is ``NULL``. If both ``rfn`` and ``rjac`` are ``NULL``,
   relaxation is disabled.

   :param arkode_mem: the ERKStep memory structure
   :param rfn: the user-defined function to compute the relaxation function
               :math:`\xi(y)`
   :param rjac: the user-defined function to compute the relaxation Jacobian
                :math:`\xi'(y)`

   :retval ARK_SUCCESS: the function exited successfully
   :retval ARK_MEM_NULL: ``arkode_mem`` was ``NULL``
   :retval ARK_ILL_INPUT: an invalid input combination was provided (see the
                          output error message for more details)
   :retval ARK_MEM_FAIL: a memory allocation failed

   .. warning::

      Applying relaxation requires using a method of at least second order with
      :math:`b_i \geq 0`. If these conditions are not satisfied,
      :c:func:`ERKStepEvolve` will return with an error during initialization.

   .. note::

      When combined with fixed time step sizes, ERKStep will attempt each step
      using the specified step size. If the step is successful, relaxation will
      be applied, effectively modifying the step size for the current step. If
      the step fails or applying relaxation fails, :c:func:`ERKStepEvolve` will
      return with an error.

   .. versionadded:: 5.6.0

Optional Input Functions
------------------------

This section describes optional input functions used to control applying
relaxation.

.. c:function:: int ERKStepSetRelaxEtaFail(void* arkode_mem, sunrealtype eta_rf)

   Sets the step size reduction factor applied after a failed relaxation
   application.

   The default value is 0.25. Input values :math:`\leq 0` or :math:`\geq 1` will
   result in the default value being used.

   :param arkode_mem: the ERKStep memory structure

   :retval ARK_SUCCESS: the value was successfully set
   :retval ARK_MEM_NULL: ``arkode_mem`` was ``NULL``

                               ``NULL``

   .. versionadded:: 5.6.0

.. c:function:: int ERKStepSetRelaxLowerBound(void* arkode_mem, sunrealtype lower)

   Sets the smallest acceptable value for the relaxation parameter.

   Values smaller than the lower bound will result in a failed relaxation
   application and the step will be repeated with a smaller step size
   (determined by :c:func:`ERKStepSetRelaxEtaFail`).

   The default value is 0.8. Input values :math:`\leq 0` or :math:`\geq 1` will
   result in the default value being used.

   The default value is 1.2. Input values :math:`\leq 1` will result in the
   default value being used.

   Sets the maximum number of times applying relaxation can fail within a step
   attempt before the integration is halted with an error.

   .. versionadded:: 5.6.0

.. c:function:: int ERKStepSetRelaxMaxIters(void* arkode_mem, int max_iters)

   relaxation parameter.

   If the maximum number of iterations is reached before meeting the solve
   tolerance (determined by :c:func:`ERKStepSetRelaxResTol` and
   :c:func:`ERKStepSetRelaxTol`), the step will be repeated with a smaller
   step size (determined by :c:func:`ERKStepSetRelaxEtaFail`).

   The default value is 10. Input values :math:`\leq 0` will result in the
   default value being used.

   :param arkode_mem: the ERKStep memory structure

   If the residual or solution tolerance (see :c:func:`ERKStepSetRelaxMaxIter`)
   is not reached within the maximum number of  iterations (determined by
   :c:func:`ERKStepSetRelaxMaxIters`), the step will be repeated with a smaller
   step size (determined by :c:func:`ERKStepSetRelaxEtaFail`).

   The default value is :math:`4 \epsilon` where :math:`\epsilon` is
   floating-point precision. Input values :math:`\leq 0` will result in the

   If the residual (see :c:func:`ERKStepSetRelaxResTol`) or solution tolerance
   is not reached within the maximum number of iterations (determined by
   :c:func:`ERKStepSetRelaxMaxIters`), the step will be repeated with a smaller
   step size (determined by :c:func:`ERKStepSetRelaxEtaFail`).

   The default relative and absolute tolerances are :math:`4 \epsilon` and
