.. _ARKODE.Usage.LSRKStep:

=======================================
Using the LSRKStep time-stepping module
=======================================

This section is concerned with the use of the LSRKStep time-stepping
module for the solution of initial value problems (IVPs) in a C or C++
language setting.  Usage of LSRKStep follows that of the rest of ARKODE,
and so in this section we primarily focus on those usage aspects that
are specific to LSRKStep.
