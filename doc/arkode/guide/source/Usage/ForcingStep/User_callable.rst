.. _ARKODE.Usage.ForcingStep.UserCallable:

ForcingStep User-callable functions
===================================

This section describes the ForcingStep-specific functions that may be called
by the user to setup and then solve an IVP using the ForcingStep time-stepping
module.

As discussed in the main :ref:`ARKODE user-callable function introduction
<ARKODE.Usage.UserCallable>`, each of ARKODE's time-stepping modules
clarifies the categories of user-callable functions that it supports.
ForcingStep does not support any of the categories beyond the functions that
apply for all time-stepping modules.


.. _ARKODE.Usage.ForcingStep.Initialization:

ForcingStep initialization functions
------------------------------------

.. c:function:: void* ForcingStepCreate(SUNStepper stepper1, SUNStepper stepper2, sunrealtype t0, N_Vector y0, SUNContext sunctx)

   This function allocates and initializes memory for a problem to be solved
   using the ForcingStep time-stepping module in ARKODE.

   :param stepper1: A :c:type:`SUNStepper` to integrate partition one. At
      minimum, it must implement the :c:func:`SUNStepper_Evolve`,
      :c:func:`SUNStepper_Reset`, and :c:func:`SUNStepper_SetStopTime`
      operations.
   :param stepper2: A :c:type:`SUNStepper` to integrate partition two
      including the forcing from partition one. At
      minimum, it must implement the :c:func:`SUNStepper_Evolve`,
      :c:func:`SUNStepper_Reset`, :c:func:`SUNStepper_SetStopTime`, and
      :c:func:`SUNStepper_SetForcing` operations.
   :param t0: The initial value of :math:`t`.
   :param y0: The initial condition vector :math:`y(t_0)`.
   :param sunctx: The :c:type:`SUNContext` object (see
      :numref:`SUNDIALS.SUNContext`)

   :return: If successful, a pointer to initialized problem memory of type
      ``void*``, to be passed to all user-facing ForcingStep routines listed
      below. If unsuccessful, a ``NULL`` pointer will be returned, and an error
      message will be printed to ``stderr``.

   **Example usage:**

      .. code-block:: C

         /* inner ARKODE objects for integrating individual partitions */
         void *partition_mem[] = {NULL, NULL};

         /* SUNSteppers to wrap the inner ARKStep objects */
         SUNStepper steppers[] = {NULL, NULL};

         /* create ARKStep objects, setting right-hand side functions and the
            initial condition */
         partition_mem[0] = ARKStepCreate(fe1, fi1, t0, y0, sunctx);
         partition_mem[1] = ARKStepCreate(fe2, fi2, t0, y0, sunctx);

         /* setup ARKStep */
         . . .

         /* create SUNStepper wrappers for the ARKStep memory blocks */
         flag = ARKodeCreateSUNStepper(partition_mem[0], &stepper[0]);
         flag = ARKodeCreateSUNStepper(partition_mem[1], &stepper[1]);

         /* create a ForcingStep object */
         arkode_mem = ForcingStepCreate(steppers[0], steppers[1], t0, y0, sunctx);

.. _ARKODE.Usage.ForcingStep.OptionalOutputs:


Optional output functions
------------------------------

.. c:function:: int ForcingStepGetNumEvolves(void* arkode_mem, int partition, long int *evolves)

   Returns the number of times the :c:type:`SUNStepper` for the given partition
   index has been evolved (so far).

   :param arkode_mem: pointer to the ForcingStep memory block.
   :param partition: index of the partition (0 or 1) or a negative number to
     indicate the total number across both partitions.
   :param evolves: number of :c:type:`SUNStepper` evolves.

   :retval ARK_SUCCESS: if successful
   :retval ARK_MEM_NULL: if the ForcingStep memory was ``NULL``
   :retval ARK_ILL_INPUT: if *partition* was out of bounds
   
   .. versionadded:: 6.2.0


ForcingStep re-initialization function
--------------------------------------

To reinitialize the ForcingStep module for the solution of a new problem,
where a prior call to :c:func:`ForcingStepCreate` has been made, the user must
call the function :c:func:`ForcingStepReInit` and re-initialize each
:c:type:`SUNStepper`.  The new problem must have the same size as the previous
one.  This routine retains the current settings for all ForcingStep module
options and performs the same input checking and initializations that are done
in :c:func:`ForcingStepCreate`, but it performs no memory allocation as it
assumes that the existing internal memory is sufficient for the new problem.  A
call to this re-initialization routine deletes the solution history that was
stored internally during the previous integration, and deletes any
previously-set *tstop* value specified via a call to
:c:func:`ARKodeSetStopTime`.  Following a successful call to
:c:func:`ForcingStepReInit`, call :c:func:`ARKodeEvolve` again for
the solution of the new problem.

One important use of the :c:func:`ForcingStepReInit` function is in the
treating of jump discontinuities in the RHS function.  Except in cases of fairly
small jumps, it is usually more efficient to stop at each point of discontinuity
and restart the integrator with a readjusted ODE model, using a call to this
routine.  To stop when the location of the discontinuity is known, simply make
that location a value of ``tout``.  To stop when the location of the
discontinuity is determined by the solution, use the rootfinding feature.  In
either case, it is critical that the RHS function *not* incorporate the
discontinuity, but rather have a smooth extension over the discontinuity, so
that the step across it (and subsequent rootfinding, if used) can be done
efficiently.  Then use a switch within the RHS function (communicated through
``user_data``) that can be flipped between the stopping of the integration and
the restart, so that the restarted problem uses the new values (which have
jumped).  Similar comments apply if there is to be a jump in the dependent
variable vector.

Another use of :c:func:`ForcingStepReInit` is changing the partitioning of
the ODE and the :c:type:`SUNStepper` objects used to evolve each partition.


.. c:function:: int ForcingStepReInit(void* arkode_mem, SUNStepper stepper1, SUNStepper stepper2, sunrealtype t0, N_Vector y0)

   Provides required problem specifications and re-initializes the ForcingStep
   time-stepper module.

   :param arkode_mem: pointer to the ForcingStep memory block.
   :param stepper1: A :c:type:`SUNStepper` to integrate partition one. At
      minimum, it must implement the :c:func:`SUNStepper_Evolve`,
      :c:func:`SUNStepper_Reset`, and :c:func:`SUNStepper_SetStopTime`
      operations.
   :param stepper2: A :c:type:`SUNStepper` to integrate partition two
      including the forcing from partition one. At
      minimum, it must implement the :c:func:`SUNStepper_Evolve`,
      :c:func:`SUNStepper_Reset`, :c:func:`SUNStepper_SetStopTime`, and
      :c:func:`SUNStepper_SetForcing` operations.
   :param t0: The initial value of :math:`t`.
   :param y0: The initial condition vector :math:`y(t_0)`.

   :retval ARK_SUCCESS: if successful
   :retval ARK_MEM_NULL: if the ForcingStep memory was ``NULL``
   :retval ARK_MEM_FAIL: if a memory allocation failed
   :retval ARK_ILL_INPUT: if an argument has an illegal value

   .. warning::

      This function does not perform any re-initialization of the
      :c:type:`SUNStepper` objects. It is up to the user to do this, if
      necessary.

   .. note::
      All previously set options are retained but may be updated by calling
      the appropriate "Set" functions.
