.. _ARKODE.Usage.ForcingStep:

==========================================
Using the ForcingStep time-stepping module
==========================================

This section is concerned with the use of the ForcingStep time-stepping module
for the solution of initial value problems (IVPs) in a C or C++ language
setting.  Usage of ForcingStep follows that of the rest of ARKODE, and so in
this section we primarily focus on those usage aspects that are specific to
ForcingStep. A skeleton of a program using ForcingStep follows essentially the
same structure as SplittingStep
(see :numref:`ARKODE.Usage.SplittingStep.Skeleton`).
