Relaxation Methods
==================

This section describes user-callable functions for applying relaxation methods
with ARKStep. For more information on relaxation Runge--Kutta methods see
:numref:`ARKODE.Mathematics.Relaxation`.

.. note::

   Relaxation support as not been evaluated with non-identity mass matrices.
   While this usage mode is supported, feedback from users who explore this
   combination would be appreciated.

Enabling or Disabling Relaxation
--------------------------------

.. c:function:: int ARKStepSetRelaxFn(void* arkode_mem, ARKRelaxFn rfn, ARKRelaxJacFn rjac)

   Attaches the user supplied functions for evaluating the relaxation function
   (``rfn``) and its Jacobian (``rjac``).

   Both ``rfn`` and ``rjac`` are required and an error will be returned if only
   one of the functions is ``NULL``. If both ``rfn`` and ``rjac`` are ``NULL``,
   relaxation is disabled.

   With DIRK and IMEX-ARK methods or when a fixed mass matrix is present,
   applying relaxation requires allocating :math:`s` additional state vectors
   (where :math:`s` is the number of stages in the method).

   :param arkode_mem: the ARKStep memory structure
   :param rfn: the user-defined function to compute the relaxation function
               :math:`\xi(y)`
   :param rjac: the user-defined function to compute the relaxation Jacobian
                :math:`\xi'(y)`

   :retval ARK_SUCCESS: the function exited successfully
   :retval ARK_MEM_NULL: ``arkode_mem`` was ``NULL``
   :retval ARK_ILL_INPUT: an invalid input combination was provided (see the
                          output error message for more details)
   :retval ARK_MEM_FAIL: a memory allocation failed

   .. warning::

      Applying relaxation requires using a method of at least second order with
      :math:`b^E_i \geq 0` and :math:`b^I_i \geq 0`. If these conditions are not
      satisfied, :c:func:`ARKStepEvolve` will return with an error during
      initialization.

   .. note::

      When combined with fixed time step sizes, ARKStep will attempt each step
      using the specified step size. If the step is successful, relaxation will
      be applied, effectively modifying the step size for the current step. If
      the step fails or applying relaxation fails, :c:func:`ARKStepEvolve` will
      return with an error.

Optional Input Functions
------------------------

This section describes optional input functions used to control applying
relaxation.

.. c:function:: int ARKStepSetRelaxEtaFail(void* arkode_mem, sunrealtype eta_rf)

   Sets the step size reduction factor applied after a failed relaxation
   application.

   The default value is 0.25. Input values :math:`\leq 0` or :math:`\geq 1` will
   result in the default value being used.

   .. versionadded:: 5.6.0

.. c:function:: int ARKStepSetRelaxLowerBound(void* arkode_mem, sunrealtype lower)

   Sets the smallest acceptable value for the relaxation parameter.

   application and the step will be repeated with a smaller step size
   (determined by :c:func:`ARKStepSetRelaxEtaFail`).

   Sets the maximum number of times applying relaxation can fail within a step
   attempt before the integration is halted with an error.

   relaxation parameter.

   If the maximum number of iterations is reached before meeting the solve
   tolerance (determined by :c:func:`ARKStepSetRelaxResTol` and
   :c:func:`ARKStepSetRelaxTol`), the step will be repeated with a smaller
   step size (determined by :c:func:`ARKStepSetRelaxEtaFail`).

   The default value is 10. Input values :math:`\leq 0` will result in the
   default value being used.

   :param arkode_mem: the ARKStep memory structure

   If the residual or iteration update tolerance (see
   :c:func:`ARKStepSetRelaxMaxIter`) is not reached within the maximum number of
   iterations (determined by :c:func:`ARKStepSetRelaxMaxIters`), the step will
   be repeated with a smaller step size (determined by
   :c:func:`ARKStepSetRelaxEtaFail`).

   floating-point precision. Input values :math:`\leq 0` will result in the

   If the residual (see :c:func:`ARKStepSetRelaxResTol`) or iterate update
   tolerance is not reached within the maximum number of iterations (determined
   by :c:func:`ARKStepSetRelaxMaxIters`), the step will be repeated with a
   smaller step size (determined by :c:func:`ARKStepSetRelaxEtaFail`).
