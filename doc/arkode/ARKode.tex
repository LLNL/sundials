This is the documentation for ARKode, an adaptive step time
integration package for stiff, nonstiff and multi-rate systems of
ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
The ARKode solver is a component of the \href{https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/main.html}{SUNDIALS} suite of
nonlinear and differential/algebraic equation solvers. It is designed
to have a similar user experience to the \href{https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/sundials/description/description.html\#descr\_cvode}{CVODE}
solver, including user modes to allow adaptive integration to specified
output times, return after each internal step and root-finding
capabilities, and for calculations in serial and using either
shared-memory parallelism (via OpenMP or Pthreads) or
distributed-memory parallelism (via MPI). The default integration and
solver options should apply to most users, though complete control
over all internal parameters and time adaptivity algorithms is enabled
through optional interface routines.

ARKode is written in C, with C++ and Fortran interfaces.

Due to its similarities in both function and design with the CVODE
package, a significant portion of this documentation has been directly
adapted from the CVODE documentation \phantomsection\label{index:id1}{\hyperref[References:hs2012]{\emph{{[}HS2012{]}}}}.

ARKode is developed by \href{http://www.smu.edu}{Southern Methodist University}, with support by the \href{http://www.doe.gov}{US Department of Energy} through the \href{http://www.fastmath-scidac.org/}{FASTMath} SciDAC Institute, under subcontract
B598130 from \href{http://www.llnl.gov}{Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory}.


\chapter{Introduction}
\label{Introduction:introduction}\label{Introduction:id1}\label{Introduction::doc}\label{Introduction:arkode-documentation}
The ARKode solver library provides an adaptive-step time integration
package for stiff, nonstiff and multi-rate systems of ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) given in explicit form
\phantomsection\label{Introduction:equation-ODE}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}M \dot{y} = f_E(t,y) + f_I(t,y),  \qquad y(t_0) = y_0,\end{split}\label{Introduction-ODE}
\end{gather}
where \(t\) is the independent variable, \(y\) is the set of
dependent variables (in \(\mathbb{R}^N\)), \(M\) is a
user-specified, nonsingular operator from \(\mathbb{R}^N\) to
\(\mathbb{R}^N\) (possibly time dependent, but independent of
\(y\)), and the right-hand side function is partitioned into two
components:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\(f_E(t,y)\) contains the ``slow'' time scale components to be
integrated explicitly, and

\item {} 
\(f_I(t,y)\)  contains the ``fast'' time scale components to be
integrated implicitly.

\end{itemize}

Either of these operators may be disabled, allowing for fully
explicit, fully implicit, or combination implicit-explicit (IMEX) time
integration.

The methods used in ARKode are adaptive-step additive Runge Kutta
methods. Such methods are defined through combining two complementary
Runge-Kutta methods: one explicit (ERK) and the other diagonally implicit
(DIRK). Through appropriately partitioning the ODE system into
explicit and implicit components \eqref{Introduction-ODE}, such methods have the
potential to enable accurate and efficient time integration of
multi-rate systems of ordinary differential equations.  A key
feature allowing for high efficiency of these methods is that only the
components in \(f_I(t,y)\) must be solved implicitly, allowing for
splittings tuned for use with optimal implicit solvers.

This framework allows for significant freedom over the constitutive
methods used for each component, and ARKode is packaged with a wide
array of built-in methods for use.  These built-in Butcher tables
include adaptive explicit methods of orders 2-8, adaptive implicit
methods of orders 2-5, and adaptive IMEX methods of orders 3-5.

For problems that include nonzero implicit term \(f_I(t,y)\), the
resulting implicit system (assumed nonlinear, unless specified
otherwise) is solved approximately at each integration step, using a
Newton method, modified Newton method, an Inexact Newton method, or an
accelerated fixed-point solver.  For the Newton-based methods and the
serial or threaded NVECTOR modules in SUNDIALS, ARKode provides both
direct (dense, band, or sparse) and preconditioned Krylov iterative
(GMRES, BiCGStab, TFQMR, FGMRES, or PCG) linear solvers.  When used
with one of the distributed parallel NVECTOR modules, including PETSc
and \emph{hypre} vectors, or a user-provided vector data structure, only
the Krylov solvers are available, although a user may supply their own
linear solver for any data structures if desired.  For the serial or
threaded vector structures, there is a banded preconditioner module
called ARKBANDPRE for use with the Krylov solvers, while for the
distributed memory parallel vector structure there is a preconditioner
module called ARKBBDPRE which provides a band-block-diagonal
preconditioner.  Additionally, a user may supply more optimal,
problem-specific preconditioner routines.


\section{Changes from previous versions}
\label{Introduction:changes-from-previous-versions}

\subsection{Changes in v1.1.0}
\label{Introduction:changes-in-v1-1-0}
We have included numerous bugfixes and enhancements since the
v1.0.2 release.

The bugfixes include:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
For each linear solver, the various solver performance counters are
now initialized to 0 in both the solver specification function and
in the solver's \code{linit} function.  This ensures that these solver
counters are initialized upon linear solver instantiation as well as
at the beginning of the problem solution.

\item {} 
The choice of the method vs embedding the Billington and TRBDF2
explicit Runge-Kutta methods were swapped, since in those the
lower-order coefficients result in an A-stable method, while the
higher-order coefficients do not.  This change results in
significantly improved robustness when using those methods.

\item {} 
A bug was fixed for the situation where a user supplies a vector of
absolute tolerances, and also uses the vector Resize() functionality.

\item {} 
A bug was fixed wherein a user-supplied Butcher table without an
embedding is supplied, and the user is running with either fixed
time steps (or they do adaptivity manually); previously this had
resulted in an error since the embedding order was below 1.

\item {} 
Numerous aspects of the documentation were fixed and/or clarified.

\end{itemize}

The feature changes/enhancements include:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Two additional NVECTOR implementations were added -- one for Hypre
(parallel) ParVector vectors, and one for PETSc vectors.  These
additions are accompanied by additions to various interface
functions and to user documentation.

\item {} 
Each NVECTOR module now includes a function, \code{N\_VGetVectorID},
that returns the NVECTOR module name.

\item {} 
A memory leak was fixed in the banded preconditioner and
banded-block-diagonal preconditioner interfaces.  In addition,
updates were done to return integers from linear solver and
preconditioner `free' routines.

\item {} 
The Krylov linear solver Bi-CGstab was enhanced by removing a
redundant dot product.  Various additions and corrections were made
to the interfaces to the sparse solvers KLU and SuperLU\_MT,
including support for CSR format when using KLU.

\item {} 
The ARKode implicit predictor algorithms were updated: methods 2 and
3 were improved slightly, a new predictor approach was added, and
the default choice was modified.

\item {} 
The underlying sparse matrix structure was enhanced to allow both
CSR and CSC matrices, with CSR supported by the KLU linear solver
interface.  ARKode interfaces to the KLU solver from both C and
Fortran were updated to enable selection of sparse matrix type, and a
Fortran-90 CSR example program was added.

\item {} 
The missing {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSpilsGetNumMtimesEvals]{\emph{\code{ARKSpilsGetNumMtimesEvals()}}}} function was added
-- this had been included in the previous documentation but had not
been implemented.

\item {} 
The handling of integer codes for specifying built-in ARKode Butcher
tables was enhanced.  While a global numbering system is still used,
methods now have \#defined names to simplify the user interface and to
streamline incorporation of new Butcher tables into ARKode.

\item {} 
The maximum number of Butcher table stages was increased from 8 to
15 to accommodate very high order methods, and an 8th-order adaptive
ERK method was added.

\item {} 
Support was added for the explicit and implicit methods in an
additive Runge-Kutta method to utilize different stage times,
solution and embedding coefficients, to support new SSP-ARK
methods.

\item {} 
The FARKODE interface was extended to include a routine to set
scalar/array-valued residual tolerances, to support Fortran
applications with non-identity mass-matrices.

\end{itemize}


\section{Reading this User Guide}
\label{Introduction:reading-this-user-guide}
This user guide is a combination of general usage instructions and
specific example programs.  We expect that some readers will want to
concentrate on teh general instructions, while others will refer
mostly to the examples, and the organization is intended to
accommodate both styles.

The structure of this document is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
In the next section we provide a thorough presentation of the
underlying {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics]{\emph{\DUspan{}{mathematics}}}} that relate these
algorithms together.

\item {} 
We follow this with overview of how the source code for ARKode is
{\hyperref[Organization:organization]{\emph{\DUspan{}{organized}}}}.

\item {} 
The largest section follows, providing a full account of the ARKode
user interface, including a description of all user-accessible
functions and outlines for ARKode usage for serial and parallel
applications. Since ARKode is written in C, we first present
{\hyperref[c_interface/index:cinterface]{\emph{\DUspan{}{the C and C++ interface}}}}, followed with a
separate section on {\hyperref[f_interface/index:fortraninterface]{\emph{\DUspan{}{using ARKode within Fortran applications}}}}.

\item {} 
The following three sections discuss shared features between ARKode
and the rest of the SUNDIALS library: {\hyperref[nvectors/index:nvectors]{\emph{\DUspan{}{vector data structures}}}}, {\hyperref[linear_solvers/index:linearsolvers]{\emph{\DUspan{}{linear solvers}}}}, and the
{\hyperref[Install:installation]{\emph{\DUspan{}{installation procedure}}}}.

\item {} 
The final sections catalog the full set of {\hyperref[Constants:constants]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode constants}}}}, that are used for both input specifications and return
codes, and the full set of {\hyperref[Butcher:butcher]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Butcher tables}}}} that are
packaged with ARKode.

\end{itemize}


\section{SUNDIALS Release License}
\label{Introduction:sundials-release-license}
The SUNDIALS packages are released open source, under a BSD license.
The only requirements of the BSD license are preservation of copyright
and a standard disclaimer of liability. Our Copyright notice is below
along with the license.

\textbf{PLEASE NOTE}  If you are using SUNDIALS with any third party
libraries linked in (e.g., LaPACK, KLU, SuperLU\_MT, PETSc, or
\emph{hypre}), be sure to review the respective license of the package as
that license may have more restrictive terms than the SUNDIALS
license.  For example, if someone builds SUNDIALS with a statically
linked KLU, the build is subject to terms of the LGPL license (which
is what KLU is released with) and \emph{not} the SUNDIALS BSD license anymore.

\chapter{Mathematical Considerations}
\label{Mathematics:mathematics}\label{Mathematics::doc}\label{Mathematics:mathematical-considerations}
ARKode solves ODE initial value problems (IVPs) in \(\mathbb{R}^N\).
These problems should be posed in explicit form, as
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-IVP}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}M\dot{y} = f_E(t,y) + f_I(t,y), \qquad y(t_0) = y_0.\end{split}\label{Mathematics-IVP}
\end{gather}
Here, \(t\) is the independent variable (e.g. time), and the
dependent variables are given by \(y \in \mathbb{R}^N\), where we
use the notation \(\dot{y}\) to denote \(\frac{dy}{dt}\).

\(M\) is a user-specified nonsingular operator from
\(\mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}^N\).  This operator may depend on
\(t\) but is currently assumed to be independent of \(y\).
For standard systems of ordinary differential equations and for
problems arising from the spatial semi-discretization of partial
differential equations using finite difference or finite volume
methods, \(M\) is typically the identity matrix, \(I\).  For
PDEs using a finite-element spatial semi-discretization \(M\) is
typically a well-conditioned mass matrix.

The two right-hand side functions may be described as:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\(f_E(t,y)\) contains the ``slow'' time scale components of the
system.  This will be integrated using explicit methods.

\item {} 
\(f_I(t,y)\) contains the ``fast'' time scale components of the
system.  This will be integrated using implicit methods.

\end{itemize}

ARKode may be used to solve stiff, nonstiff and multi-rate problems.
Roughly speaking, stiffness is characterized by the presence of at
least one rapidly damped mode, whose time constant is small compared
to the time scale of the solution itself.  In the implicit/explicit
(ImEx) splitting above, these stiff components should be included in
the right-hand side function \(f_I(t,y)\).

In the sub-sections that follow, we elaborate on the numerical
methods that comprise the ARKode solvers.  We first discuss the
general {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-ark]{\emph{\DUspan{}{formulation of additive Runge-Kutta methods}}}}, including the resulting implicit systems that must
be solved at each stage.  We then discuss the solver strategies that
ARKode uses in solving these systems: {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-nonlinear]{\emph{\DUspan{}{nonlinear solvers}}}}, {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-linear]{\emph{\DUspan{}{linear solvers}}}}
and {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-preconditioning]{\emph{\DUspan{}{preconditioners}}}}.  We then
describe our approaches for {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-error]{\emph{\DUspan{}{error control}}}}
within the iterative nonlinear and linear solvers, including
discussion on our choice of norms used within ARKode for measuring
errors within various components of the solver.  We then discuss
specific enhancements available in ARKode, including an array of
{\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-predictors]{\emph{\DUspan{}{prediction algorithms}}}} for the solution
at each stage, {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-adaptivity]{\emph{\DUspan{}{adaptive error controllers}}}}, {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-masssolve]{\emph{\DUspan{}{mass-matrix handling}}}}, and {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-rootfinding]{\emph{\DUspan{}{rootfinding capabilities}}}}.


\section{Additive Runge-Kutta methods}
\label{Mathematics:mathematics-ark}\label{Mathematics:additive-runge-kutta-methods}
The methods used in ARKode are variable-step, embedded,
\index{additive Runge-Kutta methods}additive Runge-Kutta methods (ARK), based on formulas of the
form
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-ARK}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}M z_i &= M y_{n-1} + h_n \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} A^E_{i,j} f_E(t^E_{n,j}, z_j)
              + h_n \sum_{j=1}^{i}   A^I_{i,j} f_I(t^I_{n,j}, z_j),
\quad i=1,\ldots,s, \\
M y_n &= M y_{n-1} + h_n \sum_{i=1}^{s} \left(b^E_i f_E(t^E_{n,i}, z_i)
              + b^I_i f_I(t^I_{n,i}, z_i)\right), \\
M \tilde{y}_n &= M y_{n-1} + h_n \sum_{i=1}^{s} \left(
               \tilde{b}^E_i f_E(t^E_{n,i}, z_i) +
               \tilde{b}^I_i f_I(t^I_{n,i}, z_i)\right).\end{split}\label{Mathematics-ARK}
\end{gather}
Here the \(y_n\) are computed approximations to \(y(t_n)\),
\(\tilde{y}_n\) are {[}typically{]} lower-order embedded solutions
(used in error estimation), and \(h_n \equiv t_n - t_{n-1}\) is
the step size. The internal stage times are abbreviated using the
notation \(t^E_{n,j} = t_{n-1} + c^E_j h_n\) and \(t^I_{n,j}
= t_{n-1} + c^I_j h_n\).  The ARK method is primarily defined through
the coefficients \(A^E \in \mathbb{R}^{s\times s}\),
\(A^I \in \mathbb{R}^{s\times s}\), \(b^E \in \mathbb{R}^{s}\),
\(b^I \in \mathbb{R}^{s}\), \(c^E \in \mathbb{R}^{s}\) and
\(c^I \in \mathbb{R}^{s}\), that correspond with the explicit and
implicit Butcher tables.  Additional coefficients
\(\tilde{b}^E \in \mathbb{R}^{s}\) and
\(\tilde{b}^I \in \mathbb{R}^{s}\) may be used to enable an
\emph{embedded solution} that is used to estimate error for adaptive
time-stepping.  We note that ARKode currently enforces the constraint
that these tables must share the same number of stages \(s\)
between the explicit and implicit methods in an ARK pair.

The user of ARKode must choose appropriately between one of three
classes of methods: \emph{multi-rate}, \emph{nonstiff} and \emph{stiff}.  All of
ARKode's available Butcher tables encoding the coefficients
\(c^E\), \(c^I\), \(A^E\), \(A^I\), \(b^E\),
\(b^I\), \(\tilde{b}^E\) and \(\tilde{b}^I\) are further
described in the {\hyperref[Butcher:butcher]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Appendix: Butcher tables}}}}.

For multi-rate problems, a user should provide both of the functions
\(f_E\) and \(f_I\) that define the IVP system.  For such
problems, ARKode currently implements the ARK methods proposed in
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id1}{\hyperref[References:kc2003]{\emph{{[}KC2003{]}}}}, allowing for methods having order \(q = \{3,4,5\}\).
The tables for these methods are given in the section
{\hyperref[Butcher:butcher-additive]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Additive Butcher tables}}}}.

For nonstiff problems, a user may specify that \(f_I = 0\),
i.e. the equation \eqref{Mathematics-IVP} reduces to the non-split IVP
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-IVP_explicit}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}M\dot{y} = f_E(t,y), \qquad y(t_0) = y_0.\end{split}\label{Mathematics-IVP_explicit}
\end{gather}
In this scenario, the coefficients \(A^I=0\), \(c^I=0\),
\(b^I=0\) and \(\tilde{b}^I=0\) in \eqref{Mathematics-ARK}, and the ARK
methods reduce to classical \index{explicit Runge-Kutta methods}explicit Runge-Kutta methods
(ERK).  For these classes of methods, ARKode allows orders of accuracy
\(q = \{2,3,4,5,6,8\}\), with embeddings of orders \(p
= \{1,2,3,4,5,7\}\).  These default to the {\hyperref[Butcher:butcher-heun-euler]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Heun-Euler-2-1-2}}}},
{\hyperref[Butcher:butcher-bogacki-shampine]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Bogacki-Shampine-4-2-3}}}}, {\hyperref[Butcher:butcher-zonneveld]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Zonneveld-5-3-4}}}},
{\hyperref[Butcher:butcher-cash-karp]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Cash-Karp-6-4-5}}}}, {\hyperref[Butcher:butcher-verner-6-5]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Verner-8-5-6}}}} and
{\hyperref[Butcher:butcher-fehlberg-8-7]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Fehlberg-13-7-8}}}} methods, respectively.

Finally, for stiff problems the user may specify that \(f_E = 0\),
so the equation \eqref{Mathematics-IVP} reduces to the non-split IVP
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-IVP_implicit}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}M\dot{y} = f_I(t,y), \qquad y(t_0) = y_0.\end{split}\label{Mathematics-IVP_implicit}
\end{gather}
Similarly to ERK methods, in this scenario the coefficients
\(A^E=0\), \(c^E=0\), \(b^E=0\) and \(\tilde{b}^E=0\)
in \eqref{Mathematics-ARK}, and the ARK methods reduce to classical
\index{diagonally-implicit Runge-Kutta methods}diagonally-implicit Runge-Kutta methods (DIRK).  For these
classes of methods, ARKode allows orders of accuracy \(q =
\{2,3,4,5\}\), with embeddings of orders \(p = \{1,2,3,4\}\).
These default to the {\hyperref[Butcher:butcher-sdirk-2-1]{\emph{\DUspan{}{SDIRK-2-1-2}}}},
{\hyperref[Butcher:butcher-ark-4-2-3-i]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARK-4-2-3 (implicit)}}}}, {\hyperref[Butcher:butcher-sdirk-5-4]{\emph{\DUspan{}{SDIRK-5-3-4}}}} and
{\hyperref[Butcher:butcher-ark-8-4-5-i]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARK-8-4-5 (implicit)}}}} methods, respectively.


\section{Nonlinear solver methods}
\label{Mathematics:nonlinear-solver-methods}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-nonlinear}
For both the DIRK and ARK methods corresponding to \eqref{Mathematics-IVP} and
\eqref{Mathematics-IVP_implicit}, an implicit system
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-Residual}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}G(z_i) \equiv M z_i - h_n A^I_{i,i} f_I(t^I_{n,i}, z_i) - a_i = 0\end{split}\label{Mathematics-Residual}
\end{gather}
must be solved for each stage \(z_i, i=1,\ldots,s\), where we have
the data
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}a_i \equiv M y_{n-1} + h_n \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} \left[
   A^E_{i,j} f_E(t^E_{n,j}, z_j) +
   A^I_{i,j} f_I(t^I_{n,j}, z_j) \right]\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
for the ARK methods, or
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}a_i \equiv M y_{n-1} + h_n \sum_{j=1}^{i-1}
   A^I_{i,j} f_I(t^I_{n,j}, z_j)\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
for the DIRK methods.  Here, if \(f_I(t,y)\) depends nonlinearly
on \(y\) then \eqref{Mathematics-Residual} corresponds to a nonlinear system of
equations; if \(f_I(t,y)\) depends linearly on \(y\) then this
is a linear system of equations.

For systems of either type, ARKode allows a choice of solution
strategy. The default solver choice is a variant of \index{Newton's
method}Newton's
method,
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-Newton_iteration}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}z_i^{(m+1)} = z_i^{(m)} + \delta^{(m+1)},\end{split}\label{Mathematics-Newton_iteration}
\end{gather}
where \(m\) is the Newton iteration index, and the \index{Newton
update}Newton
update \(\delta^{(m+1)}\) in turn requires the solution of the
linear \index{Newton system}Newton system
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-Newton_system}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal A}\left(z_i^{(m)}\right) \delta^{(m+1)} = -G\left(z_i^{(m)}\right),\end{split}\label{Mathematics-Newton_system}
\end{gather}
in which
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-NewtonMatrix}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal A} \approx M - \gamma J, \quad J = \frac{\partial f_I}{\partial y},
\quad\text{and}\quad \gamma = h_n A^I_{i,i}.\end{split}\label{Mathematics-NewtonMatrix}
\end{gather}
As an alternate to Newton's method, ARKode may solve for each stage
\(z_i, i=1,\ldots,s\) using an \index{Anderson-accelerated fixed
point iteration}Anderson-accelerated fixed
point iteration
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-AAFP_iteration}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}z_i^{(m+1)} = g(z_i^{(m)}), \quad m=0,1,\ldots\end{split}\label{Mathematics-AAFP_iteration}
\end{gather}
Unlike with Newton's method, this method \emph{does not} require the
solution of a linear system at each iteration, instead opting for
solution of a low-dimensional least-squares solution to construct the
nonlinear update.  For details on how this iteration is performed, we
refer the reader to the reference \phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id2}{\hyperref[References:wn2011]{\emph{{[}WN2011{]}}}}.

Finally, if the user specifies that \(f_I(t,y)\) depends linearly
on \(y\) (via a call to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetLinear]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetLinear()}}}}, or the
\emph{LINEAR} argument to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETIIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETIIN()}}}}), and if the
Newton-based nonlinear solver is chosen, then the problem
\eqref{Mathematics-Residual} will be solved using only a single Newton iteration.
In this case, an additional argument to the respective function
denotes whether this Jacobian is time-dependent or not, indicating
whether the Jacobian or preconditioner needs to be recomputed at each
step.

The optimal solver (Newton vs fixed-point) is highly
problem-dependent.  Since fixed-point solvers do not require
the solution of any linear systems, each iteration may be
significantly less costly than their Newton counterparts.  However,
this can come at the cost of slower convergence (or even divergence)
in comparison with Newton-like methods.  However, these fixed-point
solvers do allow for user specification of the Anderson-accelerated
subspace size, \(m_k\).  While the required amount of solver
memory grows proportionately to \(m_k N\), larger values of
\(m_k\) may result in faster convergence.  In our experience, this
improvement may be significant even for ``small'' values,
e.g. \(1\le m_k\le 5\), and that convergence may not improve (or
even deteriorate) for larger values of \(m_k\).

While ARKode uses a Newton-based iteration as its default solver due
to its increased robustness on very stiff problems, it is highly
recommended that users also consider the fixed-point solver for their
when attempting a new problem.

For either the Newton or fixed-point solvers, it is well-known that
both the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm intimately depends
on the choice of a good initial guess.  In ARKode, the initial guess
for either nonlinear solution method is a predicted value
\(z_i^{(0)}\) that is computed explicitly from the
previously-computed data (e.g. \(y_{n-2}\), \(y_{n-1}\), and
\(z_j\) where \(j<i\)).  Additional information on the
specific predictor algorithms implemented in ARKode is provided in the
following section, {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-predictors]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Implicit predictors}}}}.


\section{Linear solver methods}
\label{Mathematics:linear-solver-methods}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-linear}
When a Newton-based method is chosen for solving each nonlinear
system, a linear system of equations must be solved at each nonlinear
iteration.  For this solve ARKode provides several choices, including
the option of a user-supplied linear solver module.  The linear solver
modules distributed with ARKode are organized into two families: a
\emph{direct} family comprising direct linear solvers for dense, banded or
sparse matrices, and a \emph{spils} family comprising scaled, preconditioned,
iterative (Krylov) linear solvers.  The methods offered through these
modules are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
dense direct solvers, using either an internal SUNDIALS
implementation or a BLAS/LAPACK implementation (serial version
only),

\item {} 
band direct solvers, using either an internal SUNDIALS
implementation or a BLAS/LAPACK implementation (serial version
only),

\item {} 
sparse direct solvers, using either the KLU sparse matrix library
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id3}{\hyperref[References:klu]{\emph{{[}KLU{]}}}}, or the PThreads-enabled SuperLU\_MT sparse matrix library
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id4}{\hyperref[References:superlumt]{\emph{{[}SuperLUMT{]}}}} (serial or threaded vector modules only),

\item {} 
SPGMR, a scaled, preconditioned GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual)
solver without restarts,

\item {} 
SPBCG, a scaled, preconditioned Bi-CGStab (Bi-Conjugate Gradient
Stable) solver,

\item {} 
SPTFQMR, a scaled, preconditioned TFQMR (Transpose-free
Quasi-Minimal Residual) solver,

\item {} 
SPFGMR, a scaled, preconditioned Flexible GMRES (Generalized Minimal
Residual) solver without restarts, or

\item {} 
PCG, a preconditioned conjugate gradient solver for symmetric linear
systems.

\end{itemize}

For large stiff systems where direct methods are infeasible, the
combination of an implicit integrator and a preconditioned
Krylov method (SPGMR, SPBCG, SPTFQMR, SPFGMR or PCG) can yield a
powerful tool because it combines established methods for stiff
integration, nonlinear solver iteration, and Krylov (linear) iteration
with a problem-specific treatment of the dominant sources of
stiffness, in the form of a user-supplied preconditioner matrix
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id5}{\hyperref[References:bh1989]{\emph{{[}BH1989{]}}}}.  We note that the direct linear solvers
provided by SUNDIALS (dense, band and sparse), as well as the direct
linear solvers accessible through LAPACK, can only be used with the
serial and threaded vector representations.

\index{modified Newton iteration}
In the case that a direct linear solver is used (dense or band),
ARKode utilizes either a Newton or a \emph{modified Newton iteration}.  The
difference between these is that in a modified Newton method, the
matrix \({\mathcal A}\) is held fixed for multiple Newton
iterations.  More precisely, each Newton iteration is computed from
the modified equation
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-modified_Newton_system}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\tilde{\mathcal A}\left(z_i^{(m)}\right) \delta^{(m+1)} = -G\left(z_i^{(m)}\right),\end{split}\label{Mathematics-modified_Newton_system}
\end{gather}
in which
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-modified_NewtonMatrix}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\tilde{\mathcal A} \approx M - \tilde{\gamma} \tilde{J}, \quad \tilde{J} =
\frac{\partial f_I}{\partial y}(\tilde y), \quad\text{and}\quad
\tilde{\gamma} = \tilde{h} A^I_{i,i}.\end{split}\label{Mathematics-modified_NewtonMatrix}
\end{gather}
Here, the solution \(\tilde{y}\) and step size \(\tilde{h}\)
upon which the modified Jacobian rely, are merely values of the
solution and step size from a previous iteration.  In other words, the
matrix \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) is only computed rarely, and reused for
repeated stage solves.  The frequency at which  \(\tilde{\mathcal
A}\) is recomputed, and hence the choice between normal and modified
Newton iterations, is determined by the input parameter \emph{msbp} to the
input function {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetMaxStepsBetweenLSet]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetMaxStepsBetweenLSet()}}}} or with the
\emph{LSETUP\_MSBP} argument to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETIIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETIIN()}}}}.

When using the direct and band solvers for the linear systems
\eqref{Mathematics-modified_Newton_system}, the Jacobian may be supplied by a user
routine or approximated by finite-differences.  In the case of
differencing, we use the standard approximation
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}J_{i,j}(t,y) = \frac{f_{I,i}(t,y+\sigma_j e_j) - f_{I,i}(t,y)}{\sigma_j},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where \(e_j\) is the jth unit vector, and the increments
\(\sigma_j\) are given by
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\sigma_j = \max\left\{ \sqrt{U}\, |y_j|, \frac{\sigma_0}{w_j} \right\}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Here \(U\) is the unit roundoff, \(\sigma_0\) is a
dimensionless value, and \(w_j\) is the error weight defined in
\eqref{Mathematics-EWT}.  In the dense case, this approach requires \(N\)
evaluations of \(f_I\), one for each column of \(J\).  In the
band case, the columns of \(J\) are computed in groups, using the
Curtis-Powell-Reid algorithm, with the number of \(f_I\)
evaluations equal to the bandwidth.

\index{inexact Newton iteration}
In the case that an iterative linear solver is chosen, ARKode utilizes a
Newton method variant called an \emph{Inexact Newton iteration}.  Here, the
matrix \({\mathcal A}\) is not itself constructed since the
algorithms only require the product of this matrix with a given
vector.  Additionally, each Newton system \eqref{Mathematics-Newton_system} is not
solved completely, since these linear solvers are iterative (hence the
``inexact'' in the name). Resultingly. for these linear solvers
\({\mathcal A}\) is applied in a matrix-free manner,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal A}v = Mv - \gamma Jv.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The matrix-vector products \(Jv\) are obtained by either calling
an optional user-supplied routine, or through directional differencing
using the formula
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}Jv = \frac{f_I(t,y+\sigma v) - f_I(t,y)}{\sigma},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where the increment \(\sigma = 1/\|v\|\) to ensure that
\(\|\sigma v\| = 1\).

As with the modified Newton method that reused \({\mathcal A}\)
between solves, ARKode's inexact Newton iteration may also recompute the
preconditioner matrix \(P\) infrequently to balance the high costs
of matrix construction and factorization against the reduced
convergence rate that may result from a stale preconditioner.

Alternately, for some preconditioning algorithms that do not rely on
costly matrix construction and factorization operations (e.g. when
using an iterative multigrid method as preconditioner), a user may
specify that \({\mathcal A}\) and/or \(P\) should be
recomputed at every Newton iteration, since the increased rate of
convergence may more than account for the additional cost of
Jacobian/preconditioner construction.  To indicate this, a user need
only supply a negative value for the \emph{msbp} argument to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetMaxStepsBetweenLSet]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetMaxStepsBetweenLSet()}}}}, or the \emph{LSETUP\_MSBP}
argument to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETIIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETIIN()}}}}.

However, in cases where recomputation of the Newton matrix
\(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) or preconditioner matrix \(P\) is
lagged, ARKode will force recomputation of these structures only in
the following circumstances:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
when starting the problem,

\item {} 
when more than 20 steps have been taken since the last update (this
value may be changed via the \emph{msbp} argument to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetMaxStepsBetweenLSet]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetMaxStepsBetweenLSet()}}}}, or the \emph{LSETUP\_MSBP}
argument to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETIIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETIIN()}}}}),

\item {} 
when the value \(\bar{\gamma}\) of \(\gamma\) at the last
update satisfies \(\left|\gamma/\bar{\gamma} - 1\right| > 0.2\)
(this tolerance may be changed via the \emph{dgmax} argument to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetDeltaGammaMax]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetDeltaGammaMax()}}}}) or the \emph{LSETUP\_DGMAX}
argument to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETRIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETRIN()}}}},

\item {} 
when a non-fatal convergence failure just occurred,

\item {} 
when an error test failure just occurred, or

\item {} 
if the problem is linearly implicit and \(\gamma\) has
changed by a factor larger than 100 times machine epsilon.

\end{itemize}

When an update is forced due to a convergence failure, an update of
\(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) or \(P\) may or may not involve a reevaluation of
\(J\) (in \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\)) or of Jacobian data (in \(P\)),
depending on whether errors in the Jacobian were the likely cause of the
failure.  More generally, the decision is made to reevaluate \(J\)
(or instruct the user to reevaluate Jacobian data in \(P\)) when:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
starting the problem,

\item {} 
more than 50 steps have been taken since the last evaluation,

\item {} 
a convergence failure occurred with an outdated matrix, and the
value \(\bar{\gamma}\) of \(\gamma\) at the last update
satisfies \(\left|\gamma/\bar{\gamma} - 1\right| > 0.2\),

\item {} 
a convergence failure occurred that forced a step size reduction, or

\item {} 
if the problem is linearly implicit and \(\gamma\) has
changed by a factor larger than 100 times machine epsilon.

\end{itemize}

As will be further discussed in the section
{\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-preconditioning]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Preconditioning}}}}, in the case of a Krylov method,
preconditioning may be applied on the left, right, or on both sides of
\({\mathcal A}\), with user-supplied routines for the preconditioner setup
and solve operations.


\section{Iteration Error Control}
\label{Mathematics:mathematics-error}\label{Mathematics:iteration-error-control}

\subsection{Choice of norm}
\label{Mathematics:choice-of-norm}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-error-norm}
In the process of controlling errors at various levels (time
integration, nonlinear solution, linear solution), ARKode uses a
\index{weighted root-mean-square norm}weighted root-mean-square norm, denoted
\(\|\cdot\|_\text{WRMS}\), for all error-like quantities,
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-WRMS_NORM}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\|v\|_\text{WRMS} = \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left(v_i\,
w_i\right)^2\right)^{1/2}.\end{split}\label{Mathematics-WRMS_NORM}
\end{gather}
The power of this choice of norm arises in the specification of the
weighting vector \(w\), that combines the units of the problem
with the user-supplied measure of ``acceptable'' error.  To this end,
ARKode constructs and \index{error weight vector}error weight vector using the
most-recent step solution and the relative and absolute tolerances
input by the user, namely
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-EWT}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}w_i = \frac{1}{RTOL\cdot |y_i| + ATOL_i}.\end{split}\label{Mathematics-EWT}
\end{gather}
Since \(1/w_i\) represents a tolerance in the component
\(y_i\), a vector whose WRMS norm is 1 is regarded as ``small.'' For
brevity, we will typically drop the subscript WRMS on norms in the
remainder of this section.

Additionally, for problems involving a non-identity mass matrix,
\(M\ne I\), the units of equation \eqref{Mathematics-IVP} may differ from the
units of the solution \(y\).  In this case, ARKode may also
construct a \index{residual weight vector}residual weight vector,
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-RWT}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}w_i = \frac{1}{RTOL\cdot |My_i| + ATOL'_i},\end{split}\label{Mathematics-RWT}
\end{gather}
where the user may specify a separate absolute residual tolerance
value or array, \(ATOL'_i\).  The choice of weighting vector used
in any given norm is determined by the quantity being measured: values
having solution units use \eqref{Mathematics-EWT}, whereas values having equation
units use \eqref{Mathematics-RWT}.  Obviously, for problems with \(M=I\), the
weighting vectors are identical.


\subsection{Nonlinear iteration error control}
\label{Mathematics:nonlinear-iteration-error-control}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-error-nonlinear}
The stopping test for all of ARKode's nonlinear solvers is related to
the subsequent local error test, with the goal of keeping the
nonlinear iteration errors from interfering with local error control.
Denoting the final computed value of each stage solution as
\(z_i^{(m)}\), and the true stage solution solving \eqref{Mathematics-Residual}
as \(z_i\), we want to ensure that the iteration error
\(z_i - z_i^{(m)}\) is ``small'' (recall that a norm less than 1 is
already considered within an acceptable tolerance).

To this end, we first estimate the linear convergence rate \(R_i\)
of the nonlinear iteration.  We initialize \(R_i=1\), and reset it
to this value whenever \(\tilde{\mathcal A}\) or \(P\) are
updated.  After computing a nonlinear correction \(\delta^{(m)} =
z_i^{(m)} - z_i^{(m-1)}\), if \(m>0\) we update \(R_i\) as
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}R_i \leftarrow \max\{ 0.3 R_i, \left\|\delta^{(m)}\right\| / \left\|\delta^{(m-1)}\right\| \}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where the factor 0.3 is user-modifiable as the \emph{crdown} input to the
the function {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetNonlinCRDown]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetNonlinCRDown()}}}} or the \emph{NONLIN\_CRDOWN}
argument to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETRIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETRIN()}}}}.

Denoting the true time step solution as \(y(t_n)\), and the computed
time step solution (computed using the stage solutions
\(z_i^{(m)}\)) as \(y_n\), we use the estimate
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\left\| y(t_n) - y_n \right\| \approx
\max_i \left\| z_i^{(m+1)} - z_i^{(m)} \right\| \approx
\max_i R_i \left\| z_i^{(m)} - z_i^{(m-1)} \right\| =
\max_i R_i \left\| \delta^{(m)} \right\|.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Therefore our convergence (stopping) test for the nonlinear iteration
for each stage is
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-NonlinearTolerance}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}R_i \left\|\delta^{(m)} \right\| < \epsilon,\end{split}\label{Mathematics-NonlinearTolerance}
\end{gather}
where the factor \(\epsilon\) has default value 0.1, and is
user-modifiable as the \emph{nlscoef} input to the the function
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetNonlinConvCoef]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetNonlinConvCoef()}}}} or the \emph{NLCONV\_COEF} input to the
function {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETRIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETRIN()}}}}.  We allow at most 3 nonlinear
iterations (modifiable through {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetMaxNonlinIters]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetMaxNonlinIters()}}}}, or
as the \emph{MAX\_NSTEPS} argument to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETIIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETIIN()}}}}).  We also
declare the nonlinear iteration to be divergent if any of the ratios
\(\|\delta^{(m)}\| / \|\delta^{(m-1)}\| > 2.3\) with \(m>0\)
(the value 2.3 may be modified as the \emph{rdiv} input to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetNonlinRDiv]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetNonlinRDiv()}}}} or the \emph{NONLIN\_RDIV} input to
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETRIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETRIN()}}}}).  If convergence fails in the fixed
point iteration, or in the Newton iteration with \(J\) or
\({\mathcal A}\) current, we must then reduce the step size by a
factor of 0.25 (modifiable via the \emph{etacf} input to the
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetMaxCFailGrowth]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetMaxCFailGrowth()}}}} function or the \emph{ADAPT\_ETACF}
input to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETRIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETRIN()}}}}).  The integration is halted after 10
convergence failures (modifiable via the
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetMaxConvFails]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetMaxConvFails()}}}} function or the \emph{MAX\_CONVFAIL}
argument to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETIIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETIIN()}}}}).


\subsection{Linear iteration error control}
\label{Mathematics:linear-iteration-error-control}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-error-linear}
When a Krylov method is used to solve the linear systems
\eqref{Mathematics-Newton_system}, its errors must also be controlled.  To this end,
we approximate the linear iteration error in the solution vector
\(\delta^{(m)}\) using the preconditioned residual vector,
e.g. \(r = P{\mathcal A}\delta^{(m)} + PG\) for the case of left
preconditioning (the role of the preconditioner is further elaborated
on in the next section).  In an attempt to ensure that the linear
iteration errors do not interfere with the nonlinear solution error
and local time integration error controls, we require that the norm of
the preconditioned linear residual satisfies
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-LinearTolerance}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\|r\| \le \frac{\epsilon_L \epsilon}{10}.\end{split}\label{Mathematics-LinearTolerance}
\end{gather}
Here \(\epsilon\) is the same value as that used above for the
nonlinear error control.  The factor of 10 is used to ensure that the
linear solver error does not adversely affect the nonlinear solver
convergence.  Smaller values for the parameter \(\epsilon_L\) are
typically useful for strongly nonlinear and stiff ODE systems, while
easier ODE systems may benefit from a value closer to 1; by default
\(\epsilon_L = 0.05\), which may be modified by the user through
the {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSpilsSetEpsLin]{\emph{\code{ARKSpilsSetEpsLin()}}}} function.  Fortran users may adjust
this value using the \emph{DELT} argument to the functions
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPGMR]{\emph{\code{FARKSPGMR()}}}}, {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPBCG]{\emph{\code{FARKSPBCG()}}}}, {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPTFQMR]{\emph{\code{FARKSPTFQMR()}}}},
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPFGMR]{\emph{\code{FARKSPFGMR()}}}} or {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKPCG]{\emph{\code{FARKPCG()}}}}.  We note that for
linearly implicit problems the same tolerance \eqref{Mathematics-LinearTolerance}
is used for the single Newton iteration.


\section{Preconditioning}
\label{Mathematics:mathematics-preconditioning}\label{Mathematics:preconditioning}
When using an inexact Newton method to solve the nonlinear system
\eqref{Mathematics-Residual}, ARKode makes repeated use of a linear solver to solve
linear systems of the form \({\mathcal A}x = b\), where \(x\) is a
correction vector and \(b\) is a residual vector.  If this linear
system solve is done with one of the scaled preconditioned iterative
linear solvers, the efficiency of such solvers may benefit
tremendously from preconditioning. A system \({\mathcal A}x=b\) can be
preconditioned as one of:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}(P^{-1}{\mathcal A})x = P^{-1}b & \qquad\text{[left preconditioning]}, \\
({\mathcal A}P^{-1})Px = b  & \qquad\text{[right preconditioning]}, \\
(P_L^{-1} {\mathcal A} P_R^{-1}) P_R x = P_L^{-1}b & \qquad\text{[left and right
preconditioning]}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The Krylov method is then applied to a system with the
matrix \(P^{-1}{\mathcal A}\), \({\mathcal A}P^{-1}\), or
\(P_L^{-1} {\mathcal A} P_R^{-1}\), instead of \({\mathcal
A}\).  In order to improve the convergence of the Krylov iteration, the
preconditioner matrix \(P\), or the product \(P_L P_R\) in the
third case, should in some sense approximate the system matrix
\({\mathcal A}\).  Yet at the same time, in order to be
cost-effective the matrix \(P\) (or matrices \(P_L\) and
\(P_R\)) should be reasonably efficient to evaluate and solve.
Finding an optimal point in this tradeoff between rapid
convergence and low cost can be quite challenging.  Good choices are
often problem-dependent (for example, see \phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id6}{\hyperref[References:bh1989]{\emph{{[}BH1989{]}}}} for an
extensive study of preconditioners for reaction-transport systems).

The ARKode solver allows for preconditioning either side, or on both
sides, although for non-symmetric matrices \({\mathcal A}\) we
know of few situations where preconditioning on both sides is superior
to preconditioning on one side only (with the product \(P = P_L
P_R\)).  Moreover, for a given preconditioner matrix, the merits of left
vs. right preconditioning are unclear in general, and the user should
experiment with both choices.  Performance will differ between these
choices because the inverse of the left preconditioner is included in
the linear system residual whose norm is being tested in the Krylov
algorithm.  As a rule, however, if the preconditioner is the product
of two matrices, we recommend that preconditioning be done either on
the left only or the right only, rather than using one factor on each
side.  An exception to this rule is the PCG solver, that itself
assumes a symmetric matrix \({\mathcal A}\), since the PCG
algorithm in fact applies the single preconditioner matrix \(P\)
in both left/right fashion as \(P^{-1/2} {\mathcal A} P^{-1/2}\).

Typical preconditioners used with ARKode are based on approximations
to the system Jacobian, \(J = \partial f_I / \partial y\).  Since
the Newton iteration matrix involved is \({\mathcal A} = M - \gamma J\), any
approximation \(\bar{J}\) to \(J\) yields a matrix that is of
potential use as a preconditioner, namely \(P = M - \gamma
\bar{J}\). Because the Krylov iteration occurs within a Newton
iteration and further also within a time integration, and since each
of these iterations has its own test for convergence, the
preconditioner may use a very crude approximation, as long as it
captures the dominant numerical feature(s) of the system.  We have
found that the combination of a preconditioner with the Newton-Krylov
iteration, using even a relatively poor approximation to the Jacobian,
can be surprisingly superior to using the same matrix without Krylov
acceleration (i.e., a modified Newton iteration), as well as to using
the Newton-Krylov method with no preconditioning.


\section{Implicit predictors}
\label{Mathematics:implicit-predictors}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-predictors}
For problems with implicit components, ARKode will employ a prediction
algorithm for constructing the initial guesses for each Runge-Kutta
stage, \(z_i^{(0)}\).  As is well-known with nonlinear solvers,
the selection of a good initial guess can have dramatic effects on both
the speed and robustness of the nonlinear solve, enabling the
difference between rapid quadratic convergence versus divergence of
the iteration.  To this end, ARKode implements a variety of prediction
algorithms that may be selected by the user.  In each case, the stage
guesses \(z_i^{(0)}\) are constructed explicitly using
readily-available information, including the previous step solutions
\(y_{n-1}\) and \(y_{n-2}\), as well as any previous stage
solutions \(z_j, \quad j<i\).  In most cases, prediction is
performed by constructing an interpolating polynomial through
existing data, which is then evaluated at the subsequent stage times
to provide an inexpensive but (hopefully) reasonable prediction of the
subsequent solution value.  Specifically, for most Runge-Kutta
methods each stage solution satisfies
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}z_i \approx y(t^I_{n,i}),\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
so by constructing an interpolating polynomial \(p_q(t)\) through
a set of existing data, the initial guess at stage solutions may be
approximated as
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}z_i^{(0)} = p_q(t^I_{n,i}).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Denoting \([a,b]\) as the interval containing the data used to
construct \(p_q(t)\), and assuming forward integration from
\(a\to b\), it is typically the case that \(t^I_{n,j} > b\).
The dangers of using a polynomial interpolant to extrapolate values
outside the interpolation interval are well-known, with higher-order
polynomials and predictions further outside the interval resulting in
the greatest potential inaccuracies.

The various prediction algorithms therefore construct different types of
interpolant \(p_q(t)\), as described below.


\subsection{Trivial predictor}
\label{Mathematics:trivial-predictor}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-predictors-trivial}
The so-called ``trivial predictor'' is given by the formula
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}p_0(\tau) = y_{n-1}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
While this piecewise-constant interpolant is clearly not a highly
accurate candidate for problems with time-varying solutions, it is
often the most robust approach for either highly stiff problems, or
problems with implicit constraints whose violation may cause illegal
solution values (e.g. a negative density or temperature).


\subsection{Maximum order predictor}
\label{Mathematics:maximum-order-predictor}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-predictors-max}
At the opposite end of the spectrum, ARKode can construct an
interpolant \(p_q(t)\) of polynomial order up to \(q=3\).
Here, the function \(p_q(t)\) is identical to the one used for
interpolation of output solution values between time steps, i.e. for
``\index{dense output}dense output'' of \(y(t)\) for \(t_{n-1} < t < t_n\).
The order of this polynomial, \(q\), may be specified by the user
with the function {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetDenseOrder]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetDenseOrder()}}}} or with the
\emph{DENSE\_ORDER} argument to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETIIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETIIN()}}}}.

The interpolants generated are either of Lagrange or Hermite form, and
use the data \(\left\{ y_{n-2}, f_{n-2}, y_{n-1}, f_{n-1}
\right\}\), where we use \(f_{k}\) to denote \(M^{-1}
\left(f_E(t_k,y_k) + f_I(t_k,y_k)\right)\).  Defining a scaled and
shifted ``time'' variable \(\tau\) for the interval \([t_{n-2},
t_{n-1}]\) as
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\tau(t) = (t-t_n)/h_{n-1},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
we may denote the predicted stage times in the subsequent time
interval \([t_{n-1}, t_{n}]\) as
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\tau_i = c^I_i \frac{h_n}{h_{n-1}}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
We then construct the interpolants \(p(t)\) as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\(q=0\): constant interpolant
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}p_0(\tau) = \frac{y_{n-2} + y_{n-1}}{2}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
\item {} 
\(q=1\): linear Lagrange interpolant
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}p_1(\tau) = -\tau\, y_{n-2} + (1+\tau)\, y_{n-1}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
\item {} 
\(q=2\): quadratic Hermite interpolant
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}p_2(\tau) =  \tau^2\,y_{n-2} + (1-\tau^2)\,y_{n-1} + h(\tau+\tau^2)\,f_{n-1}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
\item {} 
\(q=3\): cubic Hermite interpolant
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}p_3(\tau) =  (3\tau^2 + 2\tau^3)\,y_{n-2} +
(1-3\tau^2-2\tau^3)\,y_{n-1} + h(\tau^2+\tau^3)\,f_{n-2} +
h(\tau+2\tau^2+\tau^3)\,f_{n-1}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
\end{itemize}

These higher-order predictors may be useful when using lower-order
methods in which \(h_n\) is not too large.  We further note that
although interpolants of order \(> 3\) are possible, these are not
implemented due to their increased computing and storage costs, along
with their diminishing returns due to increased extrapolation error.


\subsection{Variable order predictor}
\label{Mathematics:variable-order-predictor}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-predictors-decreasing}
This predictor attempts to use higher-order interpolations
\(p_q(t)\) for predicting earlier stages in the subsequent time
interval, and lower-order interpolants for later stages.  It uses the
same formulas as described above, but chooses \(q\) adaptively
based on the stage index \(i\), under the (rather tenuous)
assumption that the stage times are increasing, i.e. \(c^I_j < c^I_k\)
for \(j<k\):
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}q = \max\{ q_\text{max} - i,\; 1 \}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}

\subsection{Cutoff order predictor}
\label{Mathematics:cutoff-order-predictor}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-predictors-cutoff}
This predictor follows a similar idea as the previous algorithm, but
monitors the actual stage times to determine the polynomial
interpolant to use for prediction:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}q = \begin{cases}
   q_\text{max}, & \text{if}\quad \tau < \tfrac12,\\
   1, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}

\subsection{Bootstrap predictor}
\label{Mathematics:mathematics-predictors-bootstrap}\label{Mathematics:bootstrap-predictor}
This predictor does not use any information from within the preceding
step, instead using information only within the current step
\([t_{n-1},t_n]\) (including \(y_{n-1}\) and
\(f_{n-1}\)).  Instead, this approach uses the right-hand side
from a previously computed stage solution in the same step,
\(f(t_{n-1}+c^I_j h,z_j)\) to construct a quadratic Hermite
interpolant for the prediction.  If we define the constants
\(\tilde{h} = c^I_j h\) and \(\tau = c^I_i h\), the predictor
is given by
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}z_i^{(0)} = y_{n-1} + \left(\tau - \frac{\tau^2}{2\tilde{h}}\right)
   f(t_{n-1},y_{n-1}) + \frac{\tau^2}{2\tilde{h}} f(t_{n-1}+\tilde{h},z_j).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
For stages in which \(c^I_j=0\) for all previous stages
\(j = 0,\ldots,i-1\), and for the first stage of any time step
\((i=0)\), this method reduces to using the trivial predictor
\(z_i^{(0)} = y_{n-1}\).  For stages having multiple precdding
nonzero \(c^I_j\), we choose the stage having largest \(c^I_j\)
value, to minimize the amount of extrapolation induced through the
prediction.

We note that in general, each stage solution \(z_j\) has
signicantly worse accuracy than the time step solutions
\(y_{n-1}\), due to the difference between the \emph{stage order} and
the \emph{method order} in typical Runge-Kutta methods.  As a result, the
accuracy of this predictor will generally be rather limited, but it is
provided for problems in which this increased stage error is better
than the effects of extrapolation far outside of the previous time
step interval \([t_{n-2},t_{n-1}]\).

We further note that although this method could be used with
non-identity mass matrix \(M\ne I\), support for that mode is not
currently implemented, so selection of this predictor in the case that
\(M\ne I\) will result in use of the {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-predictors-trivial]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Trivial predictor}}}}.


\subsection{Minimum correction predictor}
\label{Mathematics:minimum-correction-predictor}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-predictors-minimumcorrection}
This predictor is not interpolation based; instead it utilizes all
existing stage information from the current step to create a predictor
containing all but the current stage solution.  Specifically, as
discussed in equations \eqref{Mathematics-ARK} and \eqref{Mathematics-Residual}, each stage solves
a nonlinear equation
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}z_i &= y_{n-1} + h_n \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} A^E_{i,j} f_E(t^E_{n,j}, z_j)
              + h_n \sum_{j=1}^{i}   A^I_{i,j} f_I(t^I_{n,j}, z_j), \\
\Leftrightarrow \quad & \\
G(z_i) &\equiv z_i - h_n A^I_{i,i} f_I(t^I_{n,i}, z_i) - a_i = 0.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
This prediction method merely computes the predictor \(z_i\) as
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}z_i &= y_{n-1} + h_n \sum_{j=1}^{i-1} A^E_{i,j} f_E(t^E_{n,j}, z_j)
              + h_n \sum_{j=1}^{i-1}  A^I_{i,j} f_I(t^I_{n,j}, z_j), \\
\Leftrightarrow \quad & \\
z_i &= a_i.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
We note that although this method could be also used with non-identity
mass matrix \(M\ne I\), support for that mode is not currently
implemented, so selection of this predictor in the case that
\(M\ne I\) will result in use of the {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-predictors-trivial]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Trivial predictor}}}}.


\section{Time step adaptivity}
\label{Mathematics:time-step-adaptivity}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-adaptivity}
A critical component of ARKode, making it an IVP ``solver'' rather than
just an integrator, is its adaptive control of local truncation error.
At every step, we estimate the local error, and ensure that it
satisfies tolerance conditions.  If this local error test fails, then
the step is recomputed with a reduced step size.  To this end, every
Runge-Kutta method packaged within ARKode admit an embedded solution
\(\tilde{y}_n\), as shown in equation \eqref{Mathematics-ARK}. Generally, these
embedded solutions attain a lower order of accuracy than the computed
solution \(y_n\).  Denoting these orders of accuracy as \(p\)
and \(q\), where \(p\) corresponds to the embedding and
\(q\) corresponds to the method, for the majority of embedded
methods \(p = q-1\).  These values of \(p\) and \(q\)
correspond to the global order of accuracy for the method and
embedding, hence each admit local errors satisfying \phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id7}{\hyperref[References:hw1993]{\emph{{[}HW1993{]}}}}
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-AsymptoticErrors}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\| y_n - y(t_n) \| = C h_n^{q+1} + \mathcal O(h_n^{q+2}), \\
\| \tilde{y}_n - y(t_n) \| = D h_n^{p+1} + \mathcal O(h_n^{p+2}),\end{split}\label{Mathematics-AsymptoticErrors}
\end{gather}
where \(C\) and \(D\) are constants independent of \(h\),
and where we have assumed exact initial conditions for the step,
\(y_{n-1} = y(t_{n-1})\). Combining these estimates, we have
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\| y_n - \tilde{y}_n \| = \| y_n - y(t_n) - \tilde{y}_n + y(t_n) \|
\le \| y_n - y(t_n) \| + \| \tilde{y}_n - y(t_n) \|
\le D h_n^{p+1} + \mathcal O(h_n^{p+2}).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
We therefore use this difference norm as an estimate for the local
truncation error at the step \(n\),
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-LTE}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}T_n = \beta \left(y_n - \tilde{y}_n\right) =
\beta h_n M^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^{s} \left[
\left(b^E_i - \tilde{b}^E_i\right) f_E(t^E_{n,i}, z_i) +
\left(b^I_i - \tilde{b}^I_i\right) f_I(t^I_{n,i}, z_i) \right].\end{split}\label{Mathematics-LTE}
\end{gather}
Here, \(\beta>0\) is an error \emph{bias} to help account for the error
constant \(D\); the default value of this is \(\beta = 1.5\),
and may be modified by the user through the function
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetErrorBias]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetErrorBias()}}}} or through the input \emph{ADAPT\_BIAS} to
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETRIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETRIN()}}}}.

With this LTE estimate, the local error test is simply \(\|T_n\|
< 1\), where we remind that this norm includes the user-specified
relative and absolute tolerances.  If this error test passes, the step
is considered successful, and the estimate is subsequently used to
estimate the next step size, as will be described below in the section
{\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-adaptivity-errorcontrol]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Asymptotic error control}}}}.  If the error test fails,
the step is rejected and a new step size \(h'\) is then computed
using the error control algorithms described in
{\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-adaptivity-errorcontrol]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Asymptotic error control}}}}.  A new attempt at the step
is made, and the error test is repeated.  If it fails multiple times
(as specified through the \emph{small\_nef} input to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetSmallNumEFails]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetSmallNumEFails()}}}} or the \emph{ADAPT\_SMALL\_NEF} argument
to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETIIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETIIN()}}}}, which defaults to 2), then
\(h'/h\) is limited above to 0.3 (this is modifiable via the
\emph{etamxf} argument to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetMaxEFailGrowth]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetMaxEFailGrowth()}}}} or the
\emph{ADAPT\_ETAMXF} argument to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETRIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETRIN()}}}}), and
limited below to 0.1 after an additional step failure.  After
seven error test failures (modifiable via the function
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetMaxErrTestFails]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetMaxErrTestFails()}}}} or the \emph{MAX\_ERRFAIL} argument to
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETIIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETIIN()}}}}), ARKode returns to the user with a give-up
message.

We define the step size ratio between a prospective step \(h'\)
and a completed step \(h\) as \(\eta\), i.e.
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\eta = h' / h.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
This is bounded above by \(\eta_\text{max}\) to ensure that step size
adjustments are not overly aggressive.  This value is modified
according to the step and history,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\eta_\text{max} = \begin{cases}
  \text{etamx1}, & \quad\text{on the first step (default is 10000)}, \\
  \text{growth}, & \quad\text{on general steps (default is 20)}, \\
  1, & \quad\text{if the previous step had an error test failure}.
\end{cases}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Here, the values of \emph{etamx1} and \emph{growth} may be modified by the user
in the functions {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetMaxFirstGrowth]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetMaxFirstGrowth()}}}} and
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetMaxGrowth]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetMaxGrowth()}}}}, respectively, or through the inputs
\emph{ADAPT\_ETAMX1} and \emph{ADAPT\_GROWTH} to the function
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETRIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETRIN()}}}}.

A flowchart detailing how the time steps are modified at each
iteration to ensure solver convergence and successful steps is given
in the figure below.  Here, all norms correspond to the WRMS norm, and
the error adaptivity function \textbf{arkAdapt} is supplied by one of the
error control algorithms discussed in the subsections below.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\scalebox{0.400000}{\includegraphics{time_adaptivity.png}}
\label{Mathematics:adaptivity-figure}\end{figure}

For some problems it may be preferrable to avoid small step size
adjustments.  This can be especially true for problems that construct
and factor the Newton Jacobian matrix \({\mathcal A}\) from
equation \eqref{Mathematics-NewtonMatrix} for either a direct solve, or as a
preconditioner for an iterative solve, where this construction is
computationally expensive, and where Newton convergence can be
seriously hindered through use of a somewhat incorrect
\({\mathcal A}\).  In these scenarios, the step is not changed
when \(\eta \in [\eta_L, \eta_U]\).  The default values for these
parameters are \(\eta_L = 1\) and \(\eta_U = 1.5\), though
these are modifiable through the function
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetFixedStepBounds]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetFixedStepBounds()}}}} or through the input
\emph{ADAPT\_BOUNDS} to the function {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETRIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETRIN()}}}}.

The user may supply external bounds on the step sizes within ARKode,
through defining the values \(h_\text{min}\) and \(h_\text{max}\) with
the functions {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetMinStep]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetMinStep()}}}} and
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetMaxStep]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetMaxStep()}}}}, or through the inputs \emph{MIN\_STEP} and
\emph{MAX\_STEP} to the function {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETRIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETRIN()}}}}, respectively.
These default to \(h_\text{min}=0\) and \(h_\text{max}=\infty\).

Normally, ARKode takes steps until a user-defined output value
\(t = t_\text{out}\) is overtaken, and then it computes
\(y(t_\text{out})\) by interpolation (using the same dense output
routines described in the section
{\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-predictors-max]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Maximum order predictor}}}}). However, a ``one step'' mode option
is available, where control returns to the calling program after each
step. There are also options to force ARKode not to integrate past a
given stopping point \(t = t_\text{stop}\), through the function
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetStopTime]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetStopTime()}}}} or through the input \emph{STOP\_TIME} to
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETRIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETRIN()}}}}.


\subsection{Asymptotic error control}
\label{Mathematics:asymptotic-error-control}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-adaptivity-errorcontrol}
As mentioned above, ARKode adapts the step size in order to attain
local errors within desired tolerances of the true solution.  These
adaptivity algorithms estimate the prospective step size \(h'\)
based on the asymptotic local error estimates \eqref{Mathematics-AsymptoticErrors}.
We define the values \(\varepsilon_n\), \(\varepsilon_{n-1}\)
and \(\varepsilon_{n-2}\) as
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\varepsilon_k &\ \equiv \ \|T_k\|
   \ = \ \beta \|y_n - \tilde{y}_n\|,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
corresponding to the local error estimates for three consecutive
steps, \(t_{n-3} \to t_{n-2} \to t_{n-1} \to t_n\).  These local
error history values are all initialized to 1.0 upon program
initialization, to accomodate the few initial time steps of a
calculation where some of these error estimates are undefined.  With
these estimates, ARKode implements a variety of error control
algorithms, as specified in the subsections below.


\subsubsection{PID controller}
\label{Mathematics:mathematics-adaptivity-errorcontrol-pid}\label{Mathematics:pid-controller}
This is the default time adaptivity controller used by ARKode.  It
derives from those found in \phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id8}{\hyperref[References:kc2003]{\emph{{[}KC2003{]}}}}, \phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id9}{\hyperref[References:s1998]{\emph{{[}S1998{]}}}}, \phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id10}{\hyperref[References:s2003]{\emph{{[}S2003{]}}}} and
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id11}{\hyperref[References:s2006]{\emph{{[}S2006{]}}}}.  It uses all three of the local error estimates
\(\varepsilon_n\), \(\varepsilon_{n-1}\) and
\(\varepsilon_{n-2}\) in determination of a prospective step size,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}h' \;=\; h_n\; \varepsilon_n^{-k_1/p}\; \varepsilon_{n-1}^{k_2/p}\;
     \varepsilon_{n-2}^{-k_3/p},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where the constants \(k_1\), \(k_2\) and \(k_3\) default
to 0.58, 0.21 and 0.1, respectively, though each may be changed via a
call to the C/C++ function {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetAdaptivityMethod]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetAdaptivityMethod()}}}}, or
to the Fortran function {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETADAPTIVITYMETHOD]{\emph{\code{FARKSETADAPTIVITYMETHOD()}}}}.  In this
estimate, a floor of \(\varepsilon > 10^{-10}\) is enforced to
avoid division-by-zero errors.


\subsubsection{PI controller}
\label{Mathematics:pi-controller}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-adaptivity-errorcontrol-pi}
Like with the previous method, the PI controller derives from those
found in \phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id12}{\hyperref[References:kc2003]{\emph{{[}KC2003{]}}}}, \phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id13}{\hyperref[References:s1998]{\emph{{[}S1998{]}}}}, \phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id14}{\hyperref[References:s2003]{\emph{{[}S2003{]}}}} and \phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id15}{\hyperref[References:s2006]{\emph{{[}S2006{]}}}}, but it differs in
that it only uses the two most recent step sizes in its adaptivity
algorithm,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}h' \;=\; h_n\; \varepsilon_n^{-k_1/p}\; \varepsilon_{n-1}^{k_2/p}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Here, the default values of \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) default
to 0.8 and 0.31, respectively, though they may be changed via a
call to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetAdaptivityMethod]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetAdaptivityMethod()}}}} or
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETADAPTIVITYMETHOD]{\emph{\code{FARKSETADAPTIVITYMETHOD()}}}}.  As with the previous controller,
at initialization \(k_1 = k_2 = 1.0\) and the floor of
\(10^{-10}\) is enforced on the local error estimates.


\subsubsection{I controller}
\label{Mathematics:i-controller}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-adaptivity-errorcontrol-i}
The so-called I controller is the standard time adaptivity control
algorithm in use by most available ODE solvers.  It bases the
prospective time step estimate entirely off of the current local error
estimate,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}h' \;=\; h_n\; \varepsilon_n^{-k_1/p}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
By default, \(k_1=1\), but that may be overridden by the user with
the function {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetAdaptivityMethod]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetAdaptivityMethod()}}}} or the function
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETADAPTIVITYMETHOD]{\emph{\code{FARKSETADAPTIVITYMETHOD()}}}}.


\subsubsection{Explicit Gustafsson controller}
\label{Mathematics:explicit-gustafsson-controller}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-adaptivity-errorcontrol-egus}
This step adaptivity algorithm was proposed in \phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id16}{\hyperref[References:g1991]{\emph{{[}G1991{]}}}}, and
is primarily useful in combination with explicit Runge-Kutta methods.
Using the notation of our earlier controllers, it has the form
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-expGus}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}h' \;=\; \begin{cases}
   h_1\; \varepsilon_1^{-1/p}, &\quad\text{on the first step}, \\
   h_n\; \varepsilon_n^{-k_1/p}\;
     \left(\varepsilon_n/\varepsilon_{n-1}\right)^{k_2/p}, &
   \quad\text{on subsequent steps}.
\end{cases}\end{split}\label{Mathematics-expGus}
\end{gather}
The default values of \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) are 0.367 and 0.268,
respectively, which may be changed bhy calling either
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetAdaptivityMethod]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetAdaptivityMethod()}}}} or {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETADAPTIVITYMETHOD]{\emph{\code{FARKSETADAPTIVITYMETHOD()}}}}.


\subsubsection{Implicit Gustafsson controller}
\label{Mathematics:mathematics-adaptivity-errorcontrol-igus}\label{Mathematics:implicit-gustafsson-controller}
A version of the above controller suitable for implicit Runge-Kutta
methods was introduced in \phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id17}{\hyperref[References:g1994]{\emph{{[}G1994{]}}}}, and has the form
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-impGus}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}h' = \begin{cases}
   h_1 \varepsilon_1^{-1/p}, &\quad\text{on the first step}, \\
   h_n \left(h_n / h_{n-1}\right) \varepsilon_n^{-k_1/p}
     \left(\varepsilon_n/\varepsilon_{n-1}\right)^{-k_2/p}, &
   \quad\text{on subsequent steps}.
\end{cases}\end{split}\label{Mathematics-impGus}
\end{gather}
The algorithm parameters default to \(k_1 = 0.98\) and
\(k_2 = 0.95\), but may be modified by the user with
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetAdaptivityMethod]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetAdaptivityMethod()}}}} or {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETADAPTIVITYMETHOD]{\emph{\code{FARKSETADAPTIVITYMETHOD()}}}}.


\subsubsection{ImEx Gustafsson controller}
\label{Mathematics:imex-gustafsson-controller}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-adaptivity-errorcontrol-iegus}
An ImEx version of these two preceding controllers is available in
ARKode.  This approach computes the estimates \(h'_1\) arising from
equation \eqref{Mathematics-expGus} and the estimate \(h'_2\) arising from
equation \eqref{Mathematics-impGus}, and selects
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}h' = \frac{h}{|h|}\min\left\{|h'_1|, |h'_2|\right\}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Here, equation \eqref{Mathematics-expGus} uses \(k_1\) and
\(k_2\) with default values of 0.367 and 0.268, while equation
\eqref{Mathematics-impGus} sets both parameters to the input \(k_3\) that
defaults to 0.95.  All three of these parameters may be modified with
the C/C++ function {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetAdaptivityMethod]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetAdaptivityMethod()}}}} or the
Fortran function {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETADAPTIVITYMETHOD]{\emph{\code{FARKSETADAPTIVITYMETHOD()}}}}.


\subsubsection{User-supplied controller}
\label{Mathematics:mathematics-adaptivity-errorcontrol-user}\label{Mathematics:user-supplied-controller}
Finally, ARKode allows the user to define their own time step
adaptivity function,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}h' = H(y, t, h_n, h_{n-1}, h_{n-2}, \varepsilon_n, \varepsilon_{n-1}, \varepsilon_{n-2}, q, p),\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
via a call to the C/C++ routine {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetAdaptivityFn]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetAdaptivityFn()}}}} or
the Fortran routine {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKADAPTSET]{\emph{\code{FARKADAPTSET()}}}}.


\section{Explicit stability}
\label{Mathematics:mathematics-stability}\label{Mathematics:explicit-stability}
For problems that involve a nonzero explicit component,
\(f_E(t,y) \ne 0\), explicit and ImEx Runge-Kutta methods may
benefit from addition user-supplied information regarding the explicit
stability region.  All ARKode adaptivity methods utilize estimates of
the local error.  It is often the case that such local error control
will be sufficient for method stability, since unstable steps will
typically exceed the error control tolerances.  However, for problems
in which \(f_E(t,y)\) includes even moderately stiff components,
and especially for higher-order integration methods, it may occur that
a significant number of attempted steps will exceed the error
tolerances.  While these steps will automatically be recomputed, such
trial-and-error may be costlier than desired.  In these scenarios, a
stability-based time step controller may also be useful.

Since the explicit stability region for any method depends on the
problem under consideration, as it results from the eigenvalues of the
linearized operator \(\frac{\partial f_E}{\partial y}\),
information on the maximum stable step size is not computed internally
within ARKode.  However, for many problems such information is
readily available.  For example, in an advection-diffusion calculation,
\(f_I\) may contain the stiff diffusive components and
\(f_E\) may contain the comparably nonstiff advection terms.  In
this scenario, an explicitly stable step \(h_\text{exp}\) would be
predicted as one satisfying the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)
stability condition,
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}|h_\text{exp}| < \frac{\Delta x}{|\lambda|}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where \(\Delta x\) is the spatial mesh size and \(\lambda\) is
the fastest advective wave speed.

In these scenarios, a user may supply a routine to predict this
maximum explicitly stable step size, \(|h_\text{exp}|\), by calling the
C/C++ function {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetStabilityFn]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetStabilityFn()}}}} or the Fortran
function {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKEXPSTABSET]{\emph{\code{FARKEXPSTABSET()}}}}.  If a value for
\(|h_\text{exp}|\) is supplied, it is compared against the value
resulting from the local error controller, \(|h_\text{acc}|\), and
the step used by ARKode will satisfy
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}h' = \frac{h}{|h|}\min\{c\, |h_\text{exp}|,\, |h_\text{acc}|\}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Here the explicit stability step factor (often called the ``CFL
factor'') \(c>0\) may be modified through the function
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetCFLFraction]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetCFLFraction()}}}} or through the input \emph{ADAPT\_CFL} to
the function {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETRIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETRIN()}}}}, and has a default value of
\(1/2\).


\subsection{Fixed time stepping}
\label{Mathematics:mathematics-fixedstep}\label{Mathematics:fixed-time-stepping}
While ARKode is designed for time step adaptivity, it may additionally
be called in ``fixed-step'' mode, typically used for debugging purposes
or for verification against hand-coded Runge-Kutta methods.  In this
mode, all time step adaptivity is disabled:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
temporal error control is disabled,

\item {} 
nonlinear or linear solver non-convergence results in an error
(instead of a step size adjustment),

\item {} 
no check against an explicit stability condition is performed.

\end{itemize}

Additional information on this mode is provided in the section
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionalinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional input functions}}}}.


\section{Mass matrix solver}
\label{Mathematics:mass-matrix-solver}\label{Mathematics:mathematics-masssolve}
Within the algorithms described above, there are three locations where a
linear solve of the form
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}M x = b\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
is required: (a) in constructing the time-evolved solution
\(y_n\), (b) in estimating the local temporal truncation error,
and (c) in constructing predictors for the implicit solver iteration
(see section {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-predictors-max]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Maximum order predictor}}}}).  Specifically, to
construct the time-evolved solution \(y_n\) from equation
\eqref{Mathematics-ARK} we must solve
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}&M y_n \ = \ M y_{n-1} + h_n \sum_{i=1}^{s} \left( b^E_i f_E(t^E_{n,i}, z_i)
              + b^I_i f_I(t^I_{n,i}, z_i)\right), \\
\Leftrightarrow \qquad & \\
&M (y_n -y_{n-1}) \ = \ h_n \sum_{i=1}^{s} \left(b^E_i f_E(t^E_{n,i}, z_i)
              + b^I_i f_I(t^I_{n,i}, z_i)\right), \\
\Leftrightarrow \qquad & \\
&M \nu \ = \ h_n \sum_{i=1}^{s} \left(b^E_i f_E(t^E_{n,i}, z_i)
              + b^I_i f_I(t^I_{n,i}, z_i)\right),\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
for the update \(\nu = y_n - y_{n-1}\).  Similarly, in computing
the local temporal error estimate \(T_n\) from equation \eqref{Mathematics-LTE}
we must solve systems of the form
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}M\, T_n = h \sum_{i=1}^{s} \left[
\left(b^E_i - \tilde{b}^E_i\right) f_E(t^E_{n,i}, z_i) +
\left(b^I_i - \tilde{b}^I_i\right) f_I(t^I_{n,i}, z_i) \right].\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Lastly, in constructing dense output and implicit predictors of order
2 or higher (as in the section {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-predictors-max]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Maximum order predictor}}}} above),
we must compute the derivative information \(f_k\) from the equation
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}M f_k = f_E(t_k, y_k) + f_I(t_k, y_k).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Of course, for problems in which \(M=I\) these solves are not
required; however for problems with non-identity \(M\), ARKode may
use either an iterative linear solver or a dense linear solver, in the
same manner as described in the section {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-linear]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Linear solver methods}}}} for solving
the linear Newton systems.  We note that at present, the matrix
\(M\) may depend on time \(t\) but must be independent of the
solution \(y\), since we assume that each of the above systems are
linear.

At present, for DIRK and ARK problems using a dense or band solver for
the Newton nonlinear iterations, the type of linear solver (dense or
band) for the Newton systems \({\mathcal A}\delta = -G\) must
match the type of linear solver used for these mass-matrix systems,
since \(M\) is included inside \({\mathcal A}\).  When direct
methods (dense and band) are employed, the user must supply a routine
to compute \(M\) in either dense or band form to match the
structure of \({\mathcal A}\), using either the routine
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKDlsDenseMassFn]{\emph{\code{ARKDlsDenseMassFn()}}}} or {\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKDlsBandMassFn]{\emph{\code{ARKDlsBandMassFn()}}}}.

When iterative methods are used, a routine must be supplied to perform
the mass-matrix-vector product, \(Mv\), through a call to the
routine {\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKSpilsMassTimesVecFn]{\emph{\code{ARKSpilsMassTimesVecFn()}}}}.  As with iterative solvers
for the Newton systems, preconditioning may be applied to aid in
solution of the mass matrix systems \(Mx=b\).  When using an
iterative mass matrix linear solver, we require that the norm of the
preconditioned linear residual satisfies
\phantomsection\label{Mathematics:equation-MassLinearTolerance}\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\|r\| \le \epsilon_L \epsilon,\end{split}\label{Mathematics-MassLinearTolerance}
\end{gather}
where again, \(\epsilon\) is the nonlinear solver tolerance
parameter from \eqref{Mathematics-NonlinearTolerance}.  When using iterative system
and mass matrix linear solvers, \(\epsilon_L\) may be specified
separately for both tolerances \eqref{Mathematics-LinearTolerance} and
\eqref{Mathematics-MassLinearTolerance}.

We further note that non-identity mass matrices, \(M\ne I\), are
only currently supported by the C and C++ ARKode interfaces, although
Fortran support is planned for the near future.


\section{Rootfinding}
\label{Mathematics:mathematics-rootfinding}\label{Mathematics:rootfinding}
The ARKode solver has been augmented to include a rootfinding
feature. This means that, while integrating the IVP \eqref{Mathematics-IVP}, ARKode
can also find the roots of a set of user-defined functions
\(g_i(t,y)\) that depend on \(t\) and the solution vector
\(y = y(t)\). The number of these root functions is arbitrary, and
if more than one \(g_i\) is found to have a root in any given
interval, the various root locations are found and reported in the
order that they occur on the \(t\) axis, in the direction of
integration.

Generally, this rootfinding feature finds only roots of odd
multiplicity, corresponding to changes in sign of \(g_i(t,
y(t))\), denoted \(g_i(t)\) for short. If a user root function has
a root of even multiplicity (no sign change), it will probably be
missed by ARKode. If such a root is desired, the user should
reformulate the root function so that it changes sign at the desired
root.

The basic scheme used is to check for sign changes of any
\(g_i(t)\) over each time step taken, and then (when a sign change
is found) to home in on the root (or roots) with a modified secant
method \phantomsection\label{Mathematics:id18}{\hyperref[References:hs1980]{\emph{{[}HS1980{]}}}}.  In addition, each time \(g\) is
computed, ARKode checks to see if \(g_i(t) = 0\) exactly, and if
so it reports this as a root. However, if an exact zero of any
\(g_i\) is found at a point \(t\), ARKode computes
\(g(t+\delta)\) for a small increment \(\delta\), slightly
further in the direction of integration, and if any
\(g_i(t+\delta) = 0\) also, ARKode stops and reports an
error. This way, each time ARKode takes a time step, it is guaranteed
that the values of all \(g_i\) are nonzero at some past value of
\(t\), beyond which a search for roots is to be done.

At any given time in the course of the time-stepping, after suitable
checking and adjusting has been done, ARKode has an interval
\((t_\text{lo}, t_\text{hi}]\) in which roots of the \(g_i(t)\) are to
be sought, such that \(t_\text{hi}\) is further ahead in the direction
of integration, and all \(g_i(t_\text{lo}) \ne 0\). The endpoint
\(t_\text{hi}\) is either \(t_n\), the end of the time step last
taken, or the next requested output time \(t_\text{out}\) if this comes
sooner. The endpoint \(t_\text{lo}\) is either \(t_{n-1}\), or the
last output time \(t_\text{out}\) (if this occurred within the last
step), or the last root location (if a root was just located within
this step), possibly adjusted slightly toward \(t_n\) if an exact
zero was found. The algorithm checks \(g(t_\text{hi})\) for zeros, and
it checks for sign changes in \((t_\text{lo}, t_\text{hi})\). If no sign
changes are found, then either a root is reported (if some
\(g_i(t_\text{hi}) = 0\)) or we proceed to the next time interval
(starting at \(t_\text{hi}\)). If one or more sign changes were found,
then a loop is entered to locate the root to within a rather tight
tolerance, given by
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\tau = 100\, U\, (|t_n| + |h|)\qquad (\text{where}\; U = \text{unit roundoff}).\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
Whenever sign changes are seen in two or more root functions, the one
deemed most likely to have its root occur first is the one with the
largest value of
\(\left|g_i(t_\text{hi})\right| / \left| g_i(t_\text{hi}) - g_i(t_\text{lo})\right|\),
corresponding to the closest to \(t_\text{lo}\) of the secant method
values. At each pass through the loop, a new value \(t_\text{mid}\) is
set, strictly within the search interval, and the values of
\(g_i(t_\text{mid})\) are checked. Then either \(t_\text{lo}\) or
\(t_\text{hi}\) is reset to \(t_\text{mid}\) according to which
subinterval is found to have the sign change. If there is none in
\((t_\text{lo}, t_\text{mid})\) but some \(g_i(t_\text{mid}) = 0\), then that
root is reported. The loop continues until \(\left|t_\text{hi} -
t_\text{lo} \right| < \tau\), and then the reported root location is
\(t_\text{hi}\).  In the loop to locate the root of \(g_i(t)\), the
formula for \(t_\text{mid}\) is
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}t_\text{mid} = t_\text{hi} -
\frac{g_i(t_\text{hi}) (t_\text{hi} - t_\text{lo})}{g_i(t_\text{hi}) - \alpha g_i(t_\text{lo})} ,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where \(\alpha\) is a weight parameter. On the first two passes
through the loop, \(\alpha\) is set to 1, making \(t_\text{mid}\)
the secant method value. Thereafter, \(\alpha\) is reset according
to the side of the subinterval (low vs high, i.e. toward
\(t_\text{lo}\) vs toward \(t_\text{hi}\)) in which the sign change was
found in the previous two passes. If the two sides were opposite,
\(\alpha\) is set to 1. If the two sides were the same, \(\alpha\)
is halved (if on the low side) or doubled (if on the high side). The
value of \(t_\text{mid}\) is closer to \(t_\text{lo}\) when
\(\alpha < 1\) and closer to \(t_\text{hi}\) when \(\alpha > 1\).
If the above value of \(t_\text{mid}\) is within \(\tau /2\) of
\(t_\text{lo}\) or \(t_\text{hi}\), it is adjusted inward, such that its
fractional distance from the endpoint (relative to the interval size)
is between 0.1 and 0.5 (with 0.5 being the midpoint), and the actual
distance from the endpoint is at least \(\tau/2\).

Finally, we note that when running in parallel, the ARKode rootfinding
module assumes that the entire set of root defining functions
\(g_i(t,y)\) is replicated on every MPI task.  Since in these
cases the vector \(y\) is distributed across tasks, it is the
user's responsibility to perform any necessary inter-task
communication to ensure that \(g_i(t,y)\) is identical on each task.

The family of solvers referred to as SUNDIALS consists of the solvers
CVODE and ARKode (for ODE systems), KINSOL (for nonlinear algebraic
systems), and IDA (for differential-algebraic systems).  In addition,
SUNDIALS also includes variants of CVODE and IDA with sensitivity analysis
capabilities (using either forward or adjoint methods), called CVODES and
IDAS, respectively.

The various solvers of this family share many subordinate modules.
For this reason, it is organized as a family, with a directory
structure that exploits that sharing (see the following Figures
{\hyperref[Organization:sunorg1]{\emph{\DUspan{}{SUNDIALS organization}}}} and {\hyperref[Organization:sunorg2]{\emph{\DUspan{}{SUNDIALS tree}}}}).  The following is a list of the solver packages presently
available, and the basic functionality of each:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
CVODE, a linear multistep solver for stiff and nonstiff ODE systems
\(\dot{y} = f(t,y)\) based on Adams and BDF methods;

\item {} 
CVODES, a linear multistep solver for stiff and nonstiff ODEs with
sensitivity analysis capabilities;

\item {} 
ARKode, a solver for ODE systems \(M \dot{y} = f_E(t,y) + f_I(t,y)\)
based on additive Runge-Kutta methods;

\item {} 
IDA, a linear multistep solver for differential-algebraic systems
\(F(t,y,\dot{y}) = 0\) based on BDF methods;

\item {} 
IDAS, a linear multistep solver for differential-algebraic systems with sensitivity
analysis capabilities;

\item {} 
KINSOL, a solver for nonlinear algebraic systems \(F(u) = 0\).

\end{itemize}

\section{ARKode organization}
\label{Organization:arkode-organization}
The ARKode package is written in the ANSI C language.  The
following summarizes the basic structure of the package, although
knowledge of this structure is not necessary for its use.

The overall organization of the ARKode package is shown in Figure
{\hyperref[Organization:arkorg]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode organization}}}}.  The central integration module,
implemented in the files \code{arkode.h}, \code{arkode\_impl.h} and
\code{arkode.c}, deals with the evaluation of integration stages, the
nonlinear solver \((\text{if}\; f_I(t,y)\ne 0)\), estimation of
the local truncation error, selection of step size, and interpolation
to user output points, among other issues.  ARKode currently supports
modified Newton, inexact Newton, and accelerated fixed-point solvers
for these implicit problems.  However, when using the Newton-based
iterations, or when using a non-identity mass matrix \(M\ne I\),
ARKode has flexibility in the choice of method used to solve the
linear sub-systems that arise.  Therefore, for any user problem
invoking the Newton solvers, or any user problem with \(M\ne I\),
one (or more) of the linear system solver modules should be specified
by the user, which is then invoked as needed during the integration
process.
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\caption{\emph{ARKode organization}: Overall structure of the ARKode package.
Modules specific to ARKode are distinguished by round boxes, while
generic solver and auxiliary modules are in rectangular boxes.
Note that the direct linear solvers using Lapack implementations
are not explicitly represented.  Also note that all ARK* linear
solver modules may additionally be used on mass matrix systems.}\label{Organization:arkorg}\end{figure}

For solving these linear systems, ARKode presently includes the
following linear algebra modules, organized into two families.  The
\emph{direct} family of linear solvers provides methods for the direct
solution of linear systems with dense, banded or sparse matrices and
includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
ARKDENSE: LU factorization and backsolving with dense matrices
(using either an internal implementation or BLAS/LAPACK);

\item {} 
ARKBAND: LU factorization and backsolving with banded matrices
(using either an internal implementation or BLAS/LAPACK).

\item {} 
ARKKLU: LU factorization and backsolving with
compressed-sparse-column (CSC) or compressed-sparese-row (CSR)
matrices using the KLU linear solver library \phantomsection\label{Organization:id1}{\hyperref[References:klu]{\emph{{[}KLU{]}}}}.

\item {} 
ARKSUPERLUMT: LU factorization and backsolving with
CSC matrices using the threaded SuperLU\_MT linear solver
library \phantomsection\label{Organization:id2}{\hyperref[References:superlumt]{\emph{{[}SuperLUMT{]}}}}.

\end{itemize}

The \emph{spils} family of linear solvers provides scaled preconditioned
linear solvers and includes:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
ARKSPGMR: scaled preconditioned GMRES method;

\item {} 
ARKSPBCG: scaled preconditioned Bi-CGStab method;

\item {} 
ARKSPTFQMR: scaled preconditioned TFQMR method;

\item {} 
ARKSPFGMR: scaled preconditioned flexible GMRES method;

\item {} 
ARKPCG: preconditioned conjugate gradient method;

\end{itemize}

The set of linear solver modules distributed with ARKode is
intended to be expanded in the future as new algorithms are developed,
and may additionally be expanded through user-supplied linear solver
modules, further described in the section {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:linearsolvers-custom]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Providing Alternate Linear Solver Modules}}}}.

In the case of the dense direct methods (ARKDENSE and ARKBAND), ARKode
includes an algorithm to approximate the Jacobian using difference
quotients, but the user also has the option of supplying the Jacobian
(or an approximation to it) directly.  When using the sparse direct
linear solvers (ARKKLU and ARKSUPERLUMT), the user must supply a
routine for the Jacobian (or an approximation), since difference
quotient approximations do not leverage the inherent sparsity of the
problem.  In the case of the Krylov iterative methods (ARKSPGMR,
ARKSPBCG, ARKSPTFQMR, ARKSPFGMR and ARKPCG), ARKode includes an
algorithm to approximate the product between the Jacobian matrix and a
vector, also using difference quotients.  Again, the user has the
option of supplying a routine for this operation.  For the Krylov
methods, preconditioning must be supplied by the user, in two phases:
\emph{setup} (preprocessing of Jacobian data) and \emph{solve}.  While there is
no default choice of preconditioner analagous to the
difference-quotient approximation in the direct case, the references
\phantomsection\label{Organization:id3}{\hyperref[References:bh1989]{\emph{{[}BH1989{]}}}} and \phantomsection\label{Organization:id4}{\hyperref[References:b1992]{\emph{{[}B1992{]}}}}, together with the example and demonstration
programs included with ARKode and CVODE, offer considerable assistance
in building simple preconditioners.

Each ARKode linear solver module consists of four routines,
devoted to
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
memory allocation and initialization,

\item {} 
setup of the matrix data involved,

\item {} 
solution of the system, and

\item {} 
freeing of memory.

\end{enumerate}

The setup and solution phases are separate because the evaluation of
Jacobians and preconditioners is done only periodically during the
integration process, and only as required to achieve convergence.  The
call list within the central ARKode module to each of the four
associated functions is fixed, thus allowing the central module to be
completely independent of the linear system method.

These modules are also decomposed in another way.  With the exception
of the modules interfacing to the LAPACK, KLU and SuperLU\_MT linear
solvers, each of the modules ARKDENSE, ARKBAND, ARKSPGMR, ARKSPBCG,
ARKSPTFQMR, ARKSPFGMR and ARKPCG is a set of interface routines built
on top of a generic solver module, named DENSE, BAND,
SPGMR, SPBCG, SPTFQMR, SPFGMR and PCG, respectively.  The interfaces
deal with the use of these methods in the ARKode context, whereas
the generic solvers are independent of the context where they are
used.  This separation allows for any generic solver to be replaced by
an improved version, with no necessity to revise the ARKode
package structure.

ARKode also provides two rudimentary preconditioner modules, for
use with any of the Krylov iterative linear solvers.  The first,
ARKBANDPRE is intended to be used with the serial or threaded vector
data structures (NVECTOR\_SERIAL, NVECTOR\_OPENMP and NVECTOR\_PTHREADS),
and provides a banded difference-quotient approximation to the
Jacobian as the preconditioner, with corresponding setup and solve
routines.  The second preconditioner module, ARKBBDPRE, is intended to
work with the parallel vector data structure, NVECTOR\_PARALLEL, and
generates a preconditioner that is a block-diagonal matrix with each
block being a band matrix owned by a single processor.

All state information used by ARKode to solve a given problem is
saved in a single opaque memory structure, and a pointer to that
structure is returned to the user.  There is no global data in the
ARKode package, and so in this respect it is reentrant.  State
information specific to the linear solver is saved in a separate data
structure, a pointer to which resides in the ARKode memory
structure.


\chapter{Using ARKode for C and C++ Applications}
\label{c_interface/index::doc}\label{c_interface/index:using-arkode-for-c-and-c-applications}\label{c_interface/index:cinterface}
This chapter is concerned with the use of ARKode for the solution
of initial value problems (IVPs) in a C or C++ language setting.  The
following sections treat the header files and the layout of the user's
main program, and provide descriptions of the ARKode user-callable
functions and user-supplied functions.

The example programs described in the companion document \phantomsection\label{c_interface/index:id1}{\hyperref[References:r2013]{\emph{{[}R2013{]}}}} may
be helpful. Those codes may be used as templates for new codes and are
included in the ARKode package \code{examples} subdirectory.

Users with applications written in Fortran should see the chapter
{\hyperref[f_interface/index:fortraninterface]{\emph{\DUspan{}{FARKODE, an Interface Module for FORTRAN Applications}}}}, that describes the Fortran/C interface
module, and may look to the Fortran example programs also described in
the companion document \phantomsection\label{c_interface/index:id2}{\hyperref[References:r2013]{\emph{{[}R2013{]}}}}.  These codes are also located in the
ARKode package \code{examples} directory.

The user should be aware that not all linear solver and
preconditioning modules are compatible with all NVECTOR
implementations.  For example, NVECTOR\_PARALLEL is not compatible with
the direct dense or direct band linear solvers since these linear
solver modules need to form the complete system Jacobian on a single
processor.  Specifically, the following ARKode modules can only be
used with NVECTOR\_SERIAL, NVECTOR\_OPENMP or NVECTOR\_PTHREADS: ARKDENSE,
ARKBAND (using either the internal or the LAPACK implementation),
ARKKLU, ARKSUPERLUMT and ARKBANDPRE. Also, the preconditioner
module ARKBBDPRE can only be used with NVECTOR\_PARALLEL.

ARKode uses various constants for both input and output. These are
defined as needed in this chapter, but for convenience the full list
is provided separately in the section {\hyperref[Constants:constants]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Appendix: ARKode Constants}}}}.

The relevant information on using ARKode's C and C++ interfaces is
detailed in the following sub-sections:


\section{Access to library and header files}
\label{c_interface/General:access-to-library-and-header-files}\label{c_interface/General:cinterface-headers}\label{c_interface/General::doc}
At this point, it is assumed that the installation of ARKode,
following the procedure described in the section {\hyperref[Install:installation]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode Installation Procedure}}}},
has been completed successfully.

Regardless of where the user's application program resides, its
associated compilation and load commands must make reference to the
appropriate locations for the library and header files required by
ARKode. The relevant library files are
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\code{libdir/libsundials\_arkode.lib},

\item {} 
\code{libdir/libsundials\_nvec*.lib} (one or two files),

\end{itemize}

where the file extension \code{.lib} is typically \code{.so} for shared
libraries and \code{.a} for static libraries.  The relevant header files
are located in the subdirectories
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\code{incdir/include/arkode}

\item {} 
\code{incdir/include/sundials}

\item {} 
\code{incdir/include/nvector}

\end{itemize}

The directories \code{libdir} and \code{incdir} are the installation library
and include directories, respectively.  For a default installation,
these are \code{instdir/lib} and \code{instdir/include}, respectively, where
\code{instdir} is the directory where SUNDIALS was installed (see the
section {\hyperref[Install:installation]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode Installation Procedure}}}} for further details).


\section{Data Types}
\label{c_interface/General:cinterface-datatypes}\label{c_interface/General:data-types}
The \code{sundials\_types.h} file contains the definition of the variable
type \code{realtype}, which is used by the SUNDIALS solvers for all
floating-point data.  The type ``\index{realtype}realtype'' can be set to
\code{float}, \code{double}, or \code{long double}, depending on how SUNDIALS
was installed (with the default being \code{double}). The user can change
the precision of the SUNDIALS solvers' floating-point arithmetic at the
configuration stage (see the section {\hyperref[Install:installation-cmake-options]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Configuration options (Unix/Linux)}}}}).

Additionally, based on the current precision, \code{sundials\_types.h}
defines the values \index{BIG\_REAL}BIG\_REAL to be the largest value
representable as a \code{realtype}, \index{SMALL\_REAL}SMALL\_REAL to be the
smallest positive value representable as a \code{realtype}, and
\index{UNIT\_ROUNDOFF}UNIT\_ROUNDOFF to be the smallest realtype number,
\(\varepsilon\), such that \(1.0 + \varepsilon \ne 1.0\).

Within SUNDIALS, real constants may be set to have the appropriate
precision by way of a macro called \index{RCONST}RCONST.  It is this macro
that needs the ability to branch on the definition \code{realtype}.  In
ANSI C, a floating-point constant with no suffix is stored as a
\code{double}. Placing the suffix ``F'' at the end of a floating point
constant makes it a \code{float}, whereas using the suffix ``L'' makes it a
\code{long double}. For example,

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define A 1.0}
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define B 1.0F}
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define C 1.0L}
\end{Verbatim}

defines \code{A} to be a \code{double} constant equal to 1.0, \code{B} to be a
\code{float} constant equal to 1.0, and \code{C} to be a \code{long double} constant
equal to 1.0.  The macro call \code{RCONST(1.0)} automatically expands to
1.0 if \code{realtype} is \code{double}, to \code{1.0F} if \code{realtype} is \code{float}, or
to \code{1.0L} if \code{realtype} is \code{long double}. SUNDIALS uses the \code{RCONST}
macro internally to declare all of its floating-point constants.

A user program which uses the type \code{realtype} and the \code{RCONST} macro
to handle floating-point constants is precision-independent, except for
any calls to precision-specific standard math library functions.
Users can, however, use the types \code{double}, \code{float}, or \code{long
double} in their code (assuming that this usage is consistent with
the size of \code{realtype} values that are passed to and from SUNDIALS).
Thus, a previously existing piece of ANSI C code can use SUNDIALS
without modifying the code to use \code{realtype}, so long as the
SUNDIALS libraries have been compiled using the same precision (for
details see the section {\hyperref[Install:installation]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode Installation Procedure}}}}).

SUNDIALS also defines a type ``\index{booleantype}booleantype'', that can have
values \code{TRUE} and \code{FALSE}, which is used for logic arguments
within the library.


\section{Header Files}
\label{c_interface/General:header-files}
The calling program must include several header files so that various
macros and data types can be used. The header file that is always
required is:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\code{arkode.h}, the main header file for ARKode, which defines the
several types and various constants, and includes function
prototypes.

\end{itemize}

Note that \code{arkode.h} includes \code{sundials\_types.h} directly, which
defines the types \code{realtype} and \code{booleantype} and the
constants \code{FALSE} and \code{TRUE}, so a user program does not need to
include \code{sundials\_types.h} directly.

The calling program must also include an NVECTOR implementation
header file, of the form \code{nvector\_***.h}.  See Chapter
{\hyperref[nvectors/index:nvectors]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Vector Data Structures}}}} for details for the appropriate name.  This file in
turn includes the header file \code{sundials\_nvector.h} which defines the
abstract \code{N\_Vector} data type.

If the user includes a non-trivial implicit component to their
ODE system, then each time step will require a nonlinear solver for
the resulting systems of equations.  ARKode allows an accelerated
fixed point iteration and Newton-based iterations for this solver; if
a Newton method is used then a linear solver module header file may
also be required.  Similarly, if the ODE system
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}M y' = f_I(t,y) + f_E(t,y)\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
involves a non-identity mass matrix \(M\ne I\), then each time
step will require a linear solver for systems of the form
\(Mx=b\).  The header files corresponding to the various linear
solvers built into ARKode, and that can be used with either the Newton
solver or for mass-matrix solves, are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\code{arkode\_dense.h}, which is used with the dense direct linear solver;

\item {} 
\code{arkode\_band.h}, which is used with the band direct linear solver;

\item {} 
\code{arkode\_lapack.h}, which is used with LAPACK implementations of dense
or band direct linear solvers;

\item {} 
\code{arkode\_klu.h}, which is used to interface with the KLU sparse
matrix solver library;

\item {} 
\code{arkode\_superlumt.h}, which is used to interface with the
SuperLU\_MT threaded sparse matrix solver library;

\item {} 
\code{arkode\_spgmr.h}, which is used with the scaled, preconditioned GMRES
Krylov linear solver SPGMR;

\item {} 
\code{arkode\_spbcgs.h}, which is used with the scaled, preconditioned
Bi-CGStab Krylov linear solver SPBCG;

\item {} 
\code{arkode\_sptfqmr.h}, which is used with the scaled, preconditioned
TFQMR Krylov solver SPTFQMR.

\item {} 
\code{arkode\_spfgmr.h}, which is used with the scaled, preconditioned
Flexible GMRES Krylov linear solver SPFGMR;

\item {} 
\code{arkode\_pcg.h}, which is used with the preconditioned
conjugate gradient linear solver PCG;

\end{itemize}

The header files for the dense and banded linear solvers (both
internal and LAPACK) include the file \code{arkode\_direct.h}, which defines
common functions.  This in turn includes a file (\code{sundials\_direct.h})
which defines the matrix type for these direct linear solvers
(\code{DlsMat}), as well as various functions and macros for acting on and
accessing entries of such matrices.

The header files for the sparse linear solvers include the file
\code{arkode\_sparse.h}, which defines common functions.  This in turn
includes a file (\code{sundials\_sparse.h}) which defines the matrix type
for these sparse linear solvers (\code{SlsMat}), as well as various
functions and macros for acting on and manipulating such matrices.

The header files for the Krylov iterative solvers each include
\code{arkode\_spils.h} which defines common functions and which in turn
includes a header file (\code{sundials\_iterative.h}) which enumerates the
preconditioning type and the choices for the Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization process (for the SPGMR and SPFGMR solvers).

Other headers may be needed, according to the choice of
preconditioner, etc.  For example, if preconditioning for an iterative
linear solver were performed using a block-diagonal
matrix, the header \code{sundials\_dense.h} may need to be included for
access to the underlying generic dense linear solver to be used for
preconditioning.


\section{A skeleton of the user's main program}
\label{c_interface/Skeleton::doc}\label{c_interface/Skeleton:a-skeleton-of-the-user-s-main-program}\label{c_interface/Skeleton:cinterface-skeleton}
The following is a skeleton of the user's main program (or calling
program) for the integration of an ODE IVP.  Most of the steps are
independent of the NVECTOR implementation used.  For the steps that
are not, refer to the Chapter {\hyperref[nvectors/index:nvectors]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Vector Data Structures}}}} for the specific name of
the function to be called or macro to be referenced.

\index{User main program}\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Initialize parallel or multi-threaded environment, if appropriate.

For example, call \code{MPI\_Init} to initialize MPI if used, or set
\code{num\_threads}, the number of threads to use within the threaded
vector functions, if used.

\item {} 
Set problem dimensions, etc.

This generally includes the problem size, \code{N}, and may include
the local vector length \code{Nlocal}.

\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}
The variables \code{N} and \code{Nlocal} should be of type
\code{long int}.
\end{notice}

\item {} 
Set vector of initial values

To set the vector \code{y0} of initial values, use the appropriate
functions defined by the particular NVECTOR implementation.

For native SUNDIALS vector implementations, use a call of the form

\end{enumerate}
\begin{quote}

\code{y0 = N\_VMake\_***(..., ydata);}

if the \code{realtype} array \code{ydata} containing the initial values of
\(y\) already exists.  Otherwise, create a new vector by making
a call of the form

\code{y0 = N\_VNew\_***(...);}

and then set its elements by accessing the underlying data with a
call of the form

\code{ydata = N\_VGetArrayPointer\_***(y0);}

See the sections {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Serial:nvectors-nvserial]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_SERIAL Module}}}} through
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Pthreads:nvectors-pthreads]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_PTHREADS Module}}}} for details.

For the HYPRE and PETSc vector wrappers, first create and initialize
the underlying vector, and then create the NVECTOR wrapper with a call
of the form

\code{y0 = N\_VMake\_***(yvec);}

where \code{yvec} is a HYPRE or PETSc vector.  Note that calls like
\code{N\_VNew\_***(...)} and \code{N\_VGetArrayPointer\_***(...)} are not
available for these vector wrappers.  See the sections
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_ParHyp:nvectors-parhyp]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_PARHYP Module}}}} and {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_PETSc:nvectors-nvpetsc]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_PETSC Module}}}} for details.
\end{quote}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\item {} 
Create ARKode object

Call \code{arkode\_mem = ARKodeCreate()} to create the ARKode memory
block. {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeCreate]{\emph{\code{ARKodeCreate()}}}} returns a pointer to the ARKode memory
structure. See the section {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-initialization]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode initialization and deallocation functions}}}} for
details.

\item {} 
Initialize ARKode solver

Call {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeInit()}}}} to provide required problem specifications,
allocate internal memory for ARKode, and initialize
ARKode. {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeInit()}}}} returns a flag, the value of which indicates
either success or an illegal argument value. See the section
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-initialization]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode initialization and deallocation functions}}}} for details.

\item {} 
Specify integration tolerances

Call {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSStolerances]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSStolerances()}}}} or {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSVtolerances]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSVtolerances()}}}} to
specify either a scalar relative tolerance and scalar absolute
tolerance, or a scalar relative tolerance and a vector of absolute
tolerances, respectively. Alternatively, call {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeWFtolerances]{\emph{\code{ARKodeWFtolerances()}}}}
to specify a function which sets directly the weights used in
evaluating WRMS vector norms. See the section
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-tolerances]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode tolerance specification functions}}}} for details.

If a problem with non-identity mass matrix is used, and the
solution units differ considerably from the equation units,
absolute tolerances for the equation residuals (nonlinear and
linear) may be specified separately through calls to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResStolerance]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResStolerance()}}}}, {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResVtolerance]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResVtolerance()}}}} or
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResFtolerance]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResFtolerance()}}}}.

\item {} 
Set optional inputs

Call \code{ARKodeSet*} functions to change any optional inputs that
control the behavior of ARKode from their default values. See
the section {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionalinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional input functions}}}} for details.

\item {} 
Attach linear solver module

If an implicit solve is required and a Newton-based iteration is
chosen for the solver, initialize the linear solver module with one
of the following calls (for details see the section
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-linearsolvers]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Linear solver specification functions}}}}):

\code{ier = ARKDense(...);}

\code{ier = ARKBand(...);}

\code{ier = ARKLapackDense(...);}

\code{ier = ARKSuperLUMT(...);}

\code{ier = ARKSpgmr(...);}

\code{ier = ARKSpbcg(...);}

\code{ier = ARKSptfqmr(...);}

\code{ier = ARKSpfgmr(...);}

\code{ier = ARKPcg(...);}

\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}
The direct (dense or band) and sparse linear solver options are
usable only in a serial or threaded environment.
\end{notice}

\item {} 
Set linear solver optional inputs

Call \code{ARK*Set*} functions from the selected linear solver module to
change optional inputs specific to that linear solver. See the section
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionalinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional input functions}}}} for details.

\item {} 
Attach mass matrix linear solver module

If a non-identity mass matrix solve is required, initialize the
linear mass matrix solver module with one of the following calls
(for details see the section {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-linearsolvers]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Linear solver specification functions}}}}):

\code{ier = ARKMassDense(...);}

\code{ier = ARKMassBand(...);}

\code{ier = ARKMassLapackDense(...);}

\code{ier = ARKMassLapackBand(...);}

\code{ier = ARKMassKLU(...);}

\code{ier = ARKMassSuperLUMT(...);}

\code{ier = ARKMassSpgmr(...);}

\code{ier = ARKMassSpbcg(...);}

\code{ier = ARKMassSptfqmr(...);}

\code{ier = ARKMassSpfgmr(...);}

\code{ier = ARKMassPcg(...);}

\item {} 
Set mass matrix linear solver optional inputs

Call \code{ARK*Set*} functions from the selected mass matrix linear
solver module to change optional inputs specific to that linear
solver. See the section {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionalinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional input functions}}}} for details.

\item {} 
Specify rootfinding problem

Optionally, call {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeRootInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeRootInit()}}}} to initialize a rootfinding
problem to be solved during the integration of the ODE system. See
the section {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-rootfinding]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Rootfinding initialization function}}}} for general details, and
the section {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionalinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional input functions}}}} for relevant optional
input calls.

\item {} 
Advance solution in time

For each point at which output is desired, call

\code{ier = ARKode(arkode\_mem, tout, yout, \&tret, itask)}

Here, \code{itask} specifies the return mode. The vector \code{yout}
(which can be the same as the vector \code{y0} above) will contain
\(y(t_\text{out})\). See the section
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-integration]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode solver function}}}} for details.

\item {} 
Get optional outputs

Call \code{ARK*Get*} functions to obtain optional output. See
the section {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionaloutputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional output functions}}}} for details.

\item {} 
Deallocate memory for solution vector

Upon completion of the integration, deallocate memory for the
vector \code{y} (or \code{yout}) by calling the destructor function
defined by the NVECTOR implementation:

\code{N\_VDestroy\_***(y);}

\item {} 
Free solver memory

Call \code{ARKodeFree(\&arkode\_mem)} to free the memory allocated for ARKode.

\item {} 
Finalize MPI, if used

Call \code{MPI\_Finalize} to terminate MPI.

\end{enumerate}

SUNDIALS provides some linear solvers only as a means for users to get
problems running and not as highly efficient solvers.  For example, if
solving a dense system, we suggest using the LAPACK solvers if the
size of the linear system is \(> 50,000\) (thanks to A. Nicolai
for his testing and recommendation).  The table below shows the
linear solver interfaces available in SUNDIALS packages and the vector
implementations required for use.  As an example, one cannot use the
SUNDIALS package specific dense direct solver interfaces  with the
MPI-based vector implementation.  However, as discussed in Chapter
ref\{s:gen\_linsolv\} the direct dense, direct band, and iterative spils
solvers provided with SUNDIALS are written in a way that allows a user
to develop their own solvers around them should a user so desire.

\section{User-callable functions}
\label{c_interface/User_callable::doc}\label{c_interface/User_callable:user-callable-functions}\label{c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-usercallable}
This section describes the ARKode functions that are called by the
user to setup and then solve an IVP. Some of these are
required. However, starting with the section
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionalinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional input functions}}}}, the functions listed involve
optional inputs/outputs or restarting, and those paragraphs may be
skipped for a casual use of ARKode. In any
case, refer to the preceding section, {\hyperref[c_interface/Skeleton:cinterface-skeleton]{\emph{\DUspan{}{A skeleton of the user's main program}}}}, for
the correct order of these calls.

On an error, each user-callable function returns a negative value and
sends an error message to the error handler routine, which prints the
message on \code{stderr} by default. However, the user can set a file as
error output or can provide her own error handler function
(see the section {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionalinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional input functions}}}} for details).

\subsection{ARKode tolerance specification functions}
\label{c_interface/User_callable:arkode-tolerance-specification-functions}\label{c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-tolerances}
These functions specify the integration tolerances. One of them
\textbf{should} be called before the first call to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKode]{\emph{\code{ARKode()}}}}; otherwise
default values of \code{reltol = 1e-4} and \code{abstol = 1e-9} will be
used, which may be entirely incorrect for a specific problem.

The integration tolerances \code{reltol} and \code{abstol} define a vector
of error weights, \code{ewt}.  In the case of
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSStolerances]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSStolerances()}}}}, this vector has components

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{n}{ewt}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{i}\PYG{p}{]} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{l+m+mf}{1.0}\PYG{o}{/}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{reltol}\PYG{o}{*}\PYG{n}{abs}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{y}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{i}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{o}{+} \PYG{n}{abstol}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

are given by

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

\end{Verbatim}

This vector is used in all error and convergence tests, which use a
weighted RMS norm on all error-like vectors v:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\|v\|_{WRMS} = \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (v_i\; ewt_i)^2 \right)^{1/2},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}

\code{ewt} vector, through a call to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeWFtolerances]{\emph{\code{ARKodeWFtolerances()}}}}.

Moreover, for problems involving a non-identity mass matrix
\(M\ne I\), the units of the solution vector \(y\) may differ
from the units of the IVP, posed for the vector \(My\).  When this
occurs, iterative solvers for the Newton linear systems and the mass
matrix linear systems may require a different set of tolerances.
Since the relative tolerance is dimensionless, but the absolute
tolerance encodes a measure of what is ``small'' in the units of the
respective quantity, a user may optionally define absolute tolerances
in the equation units.  In this case, ARKode defines a vector of residual
weights, \code{rwt} for measuring convergence of these iterative solvers.
In the case of {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResStolerance]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResStolerance()}}}}, this vector has components

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{n}{rwt}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{i}\PYG{p}{]} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{l+m+mf}{1.0}\PYG{o}{/}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{reltol}\PYG{o}{*}\PYG{n}{abs}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{My}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{i}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{o}{+} \PYG{n}{rabstol}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

whereas in the case of {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResVtolerance]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResVtolerance()}}}} the vector components
are given by

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{n}{rwt}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{i}\PYG{p}{]} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{l+m+mf}{1.0}\PYG{o}{/}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{reltol}\PYG{o}{*}\PYG{n}{abs}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{My}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{i}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{o}{+} \PYG{n}{rabstol}\PYG{p}{[}\PYG{n}{i}\PYG{p}{]}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

This residual weight vector is used in all iterative solver
convergence tests, which similarly use a weighted RMS norm on all
residual-like vectors v:
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\|v\|_{WRMS} = \left( \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (v_i\; rwt_i)^2 \right)^{1/2},\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where \(N\) is the problem dimension.

As with the error weight vector, the user may supply a custom function
to supply the \code{rwt} vector, through a call to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResFtolerance]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResFtolerance()}}}}.  Further information on all three of
these functions is provided below.

\subsubsection{General advice on the choice of tolerances}
\label{c_interface/User_callable:general-advice-on-the-choice-of-tolerances}
For many users, the appropriate choices for tolerance values in
\code{reltol}, \code{abstol} and \code{rabstol} are a concern. The following pieces
of advice are relevant.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
The scalar relative tolerance \code{reltol} is to be set to control
relative errors. So a value of \(10^{-4}\) means that errors
are controlled to .01\%. We do not recommend using \code{reltol} larger
than \(10^{-3}\). On the other hand, \code{reltol} should not be so
small that it is comparable to the unit roundoff of the machine
arithmetic (generally around \(10^{-15}\) for double-precision).

\item {} 
The absolute tolerances \code{abstol} (whether scalar or vector) need
to be set to control absolute errors when any components of the
solution vector \(y\) may be so small that pure relative error
control is meaningless.  For example, if \(y_i\) starts at some
nonzero value, but in time decays to zero, then pure relative
error control on \(y_i\) makes no sense (and is overly costly)
after \(y_i\) is below some noise level. Then \code{abstol} (if
scalar) or \code{abstol{[}i{]}} (if a vector) needs to be set to that
noise level. If the different components have different noise
levels, then \code{abstol} should be a vector.  For example, see the
example problem \code{ark\_robertson.c}, and the discussion
of it in the ARKode Examples Documentation \phantomsection\label{c_interface/User_callable:id1}{\hyperref[References:r2013]{\emph{{[}R2013{]}}}}.  In that
problem, the three components vary betwen 0 and 1, and have
different noise levels; hence the \code{atols} vector therein. It is
impossible to give any general advice on \code{abstol} values,
because the appropriate noise levels are completely
problem-dependent. The user or modeler hopefully has some idea as
to what those noise levels are.

\item {} 
The residual absolute tolerances \code{rabstol} (whether scalar or
vector) follow a similar explanation as for \code{abstol}, except
that these should be set to the noise level of the equation
components, i.e. the noise level of \(My\).  For problems in
which \(M=I\), it is recommended that \code{rabstol} be left
unset, which will default to the already-supplied \code{abstol}
values.

\item {} 
Finally, it is important to pick all the tolerance values
conservately, because they control the error committed on each
individual step. The final (global) errors are an accumulation of
those per-step errors, where that accumulation factor is
problem-dependent.  A general rule of thumb is to reduce the
tolerances by a factor of 10 from the actual desired limits on
errors.  I.e. if you want .01\% relative accuracy (globally), a good
choice for \code{reltol} is \(10^{-5}\).  But in any case, it is
a good idea to do a few experiments with the tolerances to see how
the computed solution values vary as tolerances are reduced.

\end{enumerate}


\subsubsection{Advice on controlling unphysical negative values}
\label{c_interface/User_callable:advice-on-controlling-unphysical-negative-values}
In many applications, some components in the true solution are always
positive or non-negative, though at times very small.  In the
numerical solution, however, small negative (unphysical) values
can then occur. In most cases, these values are harmless, and simply
need to be controlled, not eliminated, but in other cases any value
that violates a constraint may cause a simulation to halt. For both of
these scenarios the following pieces of advice are relevant.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
The best way to control the size of unwanted negative computed
values is with tighter absolute tolerances.  Again this requires
some knowledge of the noise level of these components, which may
or may not be different for different components. Some
experimentation may be needed.

\item {} 
If output plots or tables are being generated, and it is important
to avoid having negative numbers appear there (for the sake of
avoiding a long explanation of them, if nothing else), then
eliminate them, but only in the context of the output medium. Then
the internal values carried by the solver are unaffected. Remember
that a small negative value in \(y\) returned by ARKode, with
magnitude comparable to \code{abstol} or less, is equivalent to zero
as far as the computation is concerned.

\item {} 
The user's right-hand side routines \(f_E\) and \(f_I\)
should never change a negative value in the solution vector \(y\)
to a non-negative value in attempt to ``fix'' this problem,
since this can lead to numerical instability.  If the \(f_E\)
or \(f_I\) routines cannot tolerate a zero or negative value
(e.g. because there is a square root or log), then the offending
value should be changed to zero or a tiny positive number in a
temporary variable (not in the input \(y\) vector) for the
purposes of computing \(f_E(t, y)\) or \(f_I(t, y)\).

\item {} 
Positivity and non-negativity constraints on components can be
enforced by use of the recoverable error return feature in the
user-supplied right-hand side functions, \(f_E\) and
\(f_I\). When a recoverable error is encountered, ARKode will
retry the step with a smaller step size, which typically
alleviates the problem.  However, because this option involves
some additional overhead cost, it should only be exercised if the
use of absolute tolerances to control the computed values is
unsuccessful.

\subsection{Linear solver specification functions}
\label{c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-linearsolvers}\label{c_interface/User_callable:linear-solver-specification-functions}
As previously explained, the modified Newton iteration used in solving
implicit systems within ARKode requires the solution of linear
systems of the form
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal A}\left(z_i^{(m)}\right) \delta^{(m+1)} = -G\left(z_i^{(m)}\right)\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}{\mathcal A} \approx M - \gamma J, \qquad J = \frac{\partial f_I}{\partial y}.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
There are nine ARKode linear solvers currently available for this
task: ARKDENSE, ARKBAND, ARKKLU, ARKSUPERLUMT, ARKSPGMR, ARKSPBCG,
ARKSPTFQMR, ARKSPFGMR and ARKPCG.

The first two linear solvers are direct solvers based on Gaussian
elimination, and derive their names from the type of storage used for
the approximate Jacobian \(J\); ARKDENSE and ARKBAND work with
dense and banded approximations to \(J\), respectively. The
SUNDIALS suite includes both internal implementations of these two
linear solvers and interfaces to LAPACK implementations. Together,
these linear solvers are referred to as \emph{ARKDLS} (which stands for
ARKode Direct Linear Solvers).

The second two linear solvers are sparse direct solvers based on
Gaussian elimination, and require user-supplied routines to construct
\(J\) (and possibly \(M\)) in compressed-sparse-column (CSR)
or compressed-sparse-row (CSR) format.  The SUNDIALS suite does not
include internal implementations of these solver libraries, instead
requiring compilation of SUNDIALS to link with existing installations
of these libraries (if either is missing, SUNDIALS will install
without the corresponding interface routines).  Together, these linear
solvers are referred to as \emph{ARKSLS} (which stands for ARKode Sparse
Linear Solvers).

The last five ARKode linear solvers, ARKSPGMR, ARKSPBCG, ARKSPTFQMR,
ARKSPFGMR and ARKPCG, are Krylov iterative solvers, which use scaled
preconditioned GMRES, scaled preconditioned Bi-CGStab, scaled
preconditioned TFQMR, scaled preconditioned flexible GMRES, and
preconditioned conjugate gradient, respectively.  Together, they are
referred to as \emph{ARKSPILS} (which stands for ARKode Scaled
Preconditioned Iterative Linear Solvers).

With any of the Krylov methods, preconditioning can be done on the
left only, on the right only, on both the left and the right, or not
at all (except for ARKPCG that applies a single preconditioner in a
symmetric manner). For the specification of a preconditioner, see the
iterative linear solver portions of the sections
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionalinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional input functions}}}} and {\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:cinterface-usersupplied]{\emph{\DUspan{}{User-supplied functions}}}}.

If preconditioning is done, user-supplied functions should be used to
define left and right preconditioner matrices \(P_1\) and
\(P_2\) (either of which could be the identity matrix), such that
the product \(P_{1}P_{2}\) approximates the Newton matrix
\({\mathcal A} = M - \gamma J\).

To specify a ARKode linear solver, after the call to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeCreate]{\emph{\code{ARKodeCreate()}}}} but before any calls to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKode]{\emph{\code{ARKode()}}}},
the user's program must call one of the functions
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKDense]{\emph{\code{ARKDense()}}}}/{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKLapackDense]{\emph{\code{ARKLapackDense()}}}},
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKBand]{\emph{\code{ARKBand()}}}}/{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKLapackBand]{\emph{\code{ARKLapackBand()}}}},
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKKLU]{\emph{\code{ARKKLU()}}}}, {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSuperLUMT]{\emph{\code{ARKSuperLUMT()}}}},
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSpgmr]{\emph{\code{ARKSpgmr()}}}}, {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSpbcg]{\emph{\code{ARKSpbcg()}}}}, {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSptfqmr]{\emph{\code{ARKSptfqmr()}}}},
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSpfgmr]{\emph{\code{ARKSpfgmr()}}}} or {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKPcg]{\emph{\code{ARKPcg()}}}} as documented below. The
first argument passed to these functions is the ARKode memory pointer
returned by {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeCreate]{\emph{\code{ARKodeCreate()}}}}.  A call to one of the above
solver specification functions links the main ARKode integrator to a
linear solver and allows the user to specify parameters which are
specific to that solver, such as the half-bandwidths in the
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKBand]{\emph{\code{ARKBand()}}}} case.  The use of each of the linear solvers
involves certain constants and possibly some macros, that are likely
to be needed in the user code. These are available in the
corresponding header file associated with the linear solver, as
specified below.

In each case the linear solver module used by ARKode is actually built
on top of a generic linear system solver, which may be of interest in
itself. These generic solvers, denoted DENSE, BAND, KLU, SUPERLUMT,
SPGMR, SPBCG, SPTFQMR, SPFGMR and PCG, are described separately in the
section {\hyperref[linear_solvers/index:linearsolvers]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Linear Solvers in ARKode}}}}.

\subsection{Mass matrix solver specification functions}
\label{c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-massmatrixsolvers}\label{c_interface/User_callable:mass-matrix-solver-specification-functions}
As discussed in section {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-masssolve]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Mass matrix solver}}}}, if the ODE
system involves a non-identity mass matrix \(M\ne I\), then ARKode
must solve linear systems of the form
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}M x = b.\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
The same solvers listed above in the section
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-linearsolvers]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Linear solver specification functions}}}} may be used for this purpose:
DENSE, BAND, KLU, SUPERLUMT, SPGMR, SPBCG, SPTFQMR, SPFGMR and PCG.
With any of the iterative solvers (SPGMR, SPBCG, SPTFQMR, SPFGMR and PCG),
preconditioning can be applied.  For the specification of a
preconditioner, see the iterative linear solver portions of the sections
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionalinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional input functions}}}} and {\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:cinterface-usersupplied]{\emph{\DUspan{}{User-supplied functions}}}}.
If preconditioning is to be performed, user-supplied functions should
be used to define left and right preconditioner matrices \(P_1\) and
\(P_2\) (either of which could be the identity matrix), such that

To specify a mass matrix solver, after the call to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeCreate]{\emph{\code{ARKodeCreate()}}}} but before any calls to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKode]{\emph{\code{ARKode()}}}},
the user's program must call one of the functions
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKMassDense]{\emph{\code{ARKMassDense()}}}}/{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKMassLapackDense]{\emph{\code{ARKMassLapackDense()}}}},

{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKMassPcg]{\emph{\code{ARKMassPcg()}}}} as documented below. The first argument passed
to these functions is the ARKode memory pointer returned by
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeCreate]{\emph{\code{ARKodeCreate()}}}}. A call to one of these solver specification
functions links the mass matrix solve with the specified solver
module, and allows the user to specify parameters which are specific
to the desired solver.  The use of each of the linear solvers involves
certain constants and possibly some macros, that are likely to be
needed in the user code. These are available in the corresponding
header file associated with the linear solver, as specified below.

As with the Newton system solvers, the mass matrix linear system
solvers listed below are all built on top of generic SUNDIALS solver
modules.

\textbf{Notes:} To disable the rootfinding feature after it has already

rootfinding module, call \emph{ARKodeRootInit} with \emph{nrtfn = 0}.

Similarly, if a new IVP is to be solved with a call to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeReInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeReInit()}}}}, where the new IVP has no rootfinding

\subsection{ARKode solver function}
\label{c_interface/User_callable:arkode-solver-function}\label{c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-integration}
This is the central step in the solution process -- the call to perform
the integration of the IVP.  One of the input arguments (\emph{itask})
specifies one of two modes as to where ARKode is to return a
solution.  These modes are modified if the user has set a stop time
(with a call to the optional input function {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetStopTime]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetStopTime()}}}}) or
has requested rootfinding.
\index{ARKode (C function)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKode}\pysiglinewithargsret{int \bfcode{ARKode}}{void*\emph{ arkode\_mem}, realtype\emph{ tout}, N\_Vector\emph{ yout}, realtype\emph{ *tret}, int\emph{ itask}}{}
Integrates the ODE over an interval in \(t\).
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{arkode\_mem} -- pointer to the ARKode memory block.

\item {} 
\emph{tout} -- the next time at which a computed solution is desired

\item {} 
\emph{yout} -- the computed solution vector

\item {} 
\emph{tret} -- the time corresponding to \emph{yout} (output)

\item {} 
\emph{itask} -- a flag indicating the job of the solver for the next
user step.

The \emph{ARK\_NORMAL} option causes the solver to take internal steps
until it has reached or just passed the user-specified \emph{tout}
parameter. The solver then interpolates in order to return an
approximate value of \(y(tout)\).  This interpolation may be
slightly less accurate than the full time step solutions
produced by the solver, since the interpolation uses a cubic
Hermite polynomial even when the RK method is of higher order.

To ensure that this returned value has full method accuracy,
issue a call to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetStopTime]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetStopTime()}}}} before the call
to ARKode to specify a fixed stop time to end the time step
and return to the user.  Once the integrator returns at a
\emph{tstop} time, any future testing for \emph{tstop} is disabled (and
can be reenabled only though a new call to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetStopTime]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetStopTime()}}}}).

The \emph{ARK\_ONE\_STEP} option tells the solver to take just one
internal step and then return the solution at the point
reached by that step.

\end{itemize}

\item[{\textbf{Return value:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_SUCCESS} if successful

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_ROOT\_RETURN} if ARKode succeeded, and found one or more roots.
If \emph{nrtfn} is greater than 1, call {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeGetRootInfo]{\emph{\code{ARKodeGetRootInfo()}}}} to see
which \(g_i\) were found to have a root at (\emph{*tret}).

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_TSTOP\_RETURN} if ARKode succeeded and returned at \emph{tstop}.

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_MEM\_NULL} if the \emph{arkode\_mem} argument was \code{NULL}.

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_NO\_MALLOC} if \emph{arkode\_mem} was not allocated.

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_ILL\_INPUT} if one of the inputs to ARKode is illegal, or
some other input to the solver was either illegal or missing.
Details will be provided in the error message.  Typical causes
of this failure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
The tolerances have not been set.

\item {} 
A component of the error weight vector became zero during
internal time-stepping.

\item {} 
The linear solver initialization function (called by the
user after calling {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeCreate]{\emph{\code{ARKodeCreate()}}}}) failed to set
the linear solver-specific \emph{lsolve} field in
\emph{arkode\_mem}.

\item {} 
A root of one of the root functions was found both at a
point \(t\) and also very near \(t\).

\end{enumerate}

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_TOO\_MUCH\_WORK} if the solver took \emph{mxstep} internal steps
but could not reach \emph{tout}.  The default value for \emph{mxstep} is
\emph{MXSTEP\_DEFAULT = 500}.

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_TOO\_MUCH\_ACC} if the solver could not satisfy the accuracy
demanded by the user for some internal step.

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_ERR\_FAILURE} if error test failures occurred either too many
times (\emph{ark\_maxnef}) during one internal time step or occurred
with \(|h| = h_{min}\).

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_CONV\_FAILURE} if either convergence test failures occurred
too many times (\emph{ark\_maxncf}) during one internal time step or
occurred with \(|h| = h_{min}\).

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_LINIT\_FAIL} if the linear solver's initialization function failed.

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_LSETUP\_FAIL} if the linear solver's setup routine failed in
an unrecoverable manner.

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_LSOLVE\_FAIL} if the linear solver's solve routine failed in
an unrecoverable manner.

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_MASSINIT\_FAIL} if the mass matrix solver's
initialization function failed.

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_MASSSETUP\_FAIL} if the mass matrix solver's setup routine
failed.

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_MASSSOLVE\_FAIL} if the mass matrix solver's solve routine
failed.

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Notes:} The input vector \emph{yout} can use the same memory as the
vector \emph{y0} of initial conditions that was passed to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeInit()}}}}.

In \emph{ARK\_ONE\_STEP} mode, \emph{tout} is used only on the first call, and
only to get the direction and a rough scale of the independent
variable. All failure return values are negative and so testing the
return argument for negative values will trap all ARKode failures.

On any error return in which one or more internal steps were taken
by ARKode, the returned values of \emph{tret} and \emph{yout} correspond to
the farthest point reached in the integration.  On all other error
returns, \emph{tret} and \emph{yout} are left unchanged from those provided
to the routine.

\end{fulllineitems}



\subsection{Optional input functions}
\label{c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionalinputs}\label{c_interface/User_callable:optional-input-functions}
There are numerous optional input parameters that control the behavior
of the ARKode solver, each of which may be modified from its default
value through calling an appropriate input function.  The following
tables list all optional input functions, grouped by which aspect of
ARKode they control.  Detailed information on the calling syntax and
arguments for each function are then provided following each table.

The optional inputs are grouped into the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
General solver options ({\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-arkodeinputtable]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional inputs for ARKode}}}}),

\item {} 
IVP method solver options ({\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-arkodemethodinputtable]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional inputs for IVP method selection}}}}),

\item {} 
Step adaptivity solver options ({\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-arkodeadaptivityinputtable]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional inputs for time step adaptivity}}}}),

\item {} 
Implicit stage solver options ({\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-cinterface-arkodesolverinputtable]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional inputs for implicit stage solves}}}}),

\item {} 
Direct linear solver options ({\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-arkdlsinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Dense/band direct linear solvers optional input functions}}}}),

\item {} 
Sparse linear solver options ({\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-arkslsinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Sparse direct linear solvers optional input functions}}}}),

\item {} 
Iterative linear solver options ({\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-arkspilsinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Iterative linear solvers optional input functions}}}}).

\end{itemize}

For the most casual use of ARKode, relying on the default set of
solver parameters, the reader can skip to the following section,
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:cinterface-usersupplied]{\emph{\DUspan{}{User-supplied functions}}}}.

We note that, on an error return, all of the optional input functions
send an error message to the error handler function.  We also note
that all error return values are negative, so a test on the return
arguments for negative values will catch all errors.

The ARKDENSE solver needs a function to compute a dense approximation
to the Jacobian matrix \(J(t,y)\). This function must be of type
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKDlsDenseJacFn]{\emph{\code{ARKDlsDenseJacFn()}}}}.  The user can supply a custom dense
Jacobian function, or use the default internal difference quotient
approximation that comes with the ARKDENSE solver.  To specify a
user-supplied Jacobian function \emph{djac}, ARKDENSE provides the
function {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKDlsSetDenseJacFn]{\emph{\code{ARKDlsSetDenseJacFn()}}}}. The ARKDENSE solver
passes the user data pointer to the dense Jacobian function. This
allows the user to create an arbitrary structure with relevant problem

function, without using global data in the program. The user
data pointer may be specified through {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetUserData]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetUserData()}}}}.

Similarly, if the ODE system involves a non-identity mass matrix,
\(M\ne I\), the ARKDENSE solver needs a function to compute a
dense approximation to the mass matrix \(M(t)\). If the Newton
linear systems are solved using ARKDENSE and the mass matrix systems

When using a sparse direct solver, there may be instances when the
number of state variables does not change, but the number of nonzeroes
in the Jacobian or mass matrix does change.  In this case, for the
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKKLU]{\emph{\code{ARKKLU()}}}} and {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKMassKLU]{\emph{\code{ARKMassKLU()}}}} solvers, we provide the
following reinitialization functions.  These functions reinitialize
the Jacobian or mass matrix memory for the new number of nonzeroes and
sets flags for a new factorization (symbolic and numeric) to be
conducted at the next solver setup call.  These routines are useful in
the cases where the number of nonzeroes has changed, or where the
structure of the linear system has changed, requiring a new symbolic
(and numeric) factorization.

\subsubsection{Iterative linear solvers optional input functions}
\label{c_interface/User_callable:iterative-linear-solvers-optional-input-functions}\label{c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-arkspilsinputs}
As described in the section {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-linear]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Linear solver methods}}}}, when using one
of the ARKSPILS iterative linear solvers, a user may supply a
preconditioning operator to aid in solution of the system.  This
operator consists of two user-supplied functions, \emph{psetup} and
\emph{psolve}, that are supplied to ARKode using either the function
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSpilsSetPreconditioner]{\emph{\code{ARKSpilsSetPreconditioner()}}}} (for preconditioning the
Newton system), or the function
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSpilsSetMassPreconditioner]{\emph{\code{ARKSpilsSetMassPreconditioner()}}}} (for preconditioning the
mass matrix system).  The \emph{psetup} function should handle evaluation
and preprocessing of any Jacobian or mass-matrix data needed by the
user's preconditioner solve function, \emph{psolve}.  The user data pointer
received through {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetUserData]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetUserData()}}}} (or a pointer to
\code{NULL} if user data was not specified) is passed to the \emph{psetup} and
\emph{psolve} functions.  This allows the user to create an arbitrary
structure with relevant problem data and access it during the
execution of the user-supplied preconditioner functions without using
global data in the program.  If preconditioning is supplied for both
the Newton and mass matrix linear systems, it is expected that the
user will supply different \emph{psetup} and \emph{psolve} function for each.

Additionally, when solving the Newton linear systems, the ARKSPILS
solvers require a \emph{jtimes} function to compute an approximation to the
product between the Jacobian matrix \(J(t,y)\) and a vector
\(v\). The user can supply a custom Jacobian-times-vector
approximation function, or use the default internal difference
quotient function that comes with the ARKSPILS solvers.  A
user-defined Jacobian-vector function must be of type
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKSpilsJacTimesVecFn]{\emph{\code{ARKSpilsJacTimesVecFn()}}}} and can be specified through a call
to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSpilsSetJacTimesVecFn]{\emph{\code{ARKSpilsSetJacTimesVecFn()}}}} (see the section
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:cinterface-usersupplied]{\emph{\DUspan{}{User-supplied functions}}}} for specification details).  As with the
preconditioner user-supplied functions, a pointer to the user-defined
data structure, \emph{user\_data}, specified through
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetUserData]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetUserData()}}}} (or a \code{NULL} pointer otherwise) is
passed to the Jacobian-times-vector function \emph{jtimes} each time it
is called.

Similarly, if a problem involves a non-identity mass matrix,
\(M\ne I\), then the ARKSPILS solvers require a \emph{mtimes} function
to compute an approximation to the product between the mass matrix
\(M(t)\) and a vector \(v\).  This function must be
user-supplied, since there is no default value.  \emph{mtimes} must be
of type {\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKSpilsMassTimesVecFn]{\emph{\code{ARKSpilsMassTimesVecFn()}}}}.  and can be specified
through a call to the  {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSpilsSetMassTimesVecFn]{\emph{\code{ARKSpilsSetMassTimesVecFn()}}}}.
If an ARKSPILS solver is also used for the mass matrix linear systems,
then the \emph{mtimes} function will already be provided in the call to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKMassSpgmr]{\emph{\code{ARKMassSpgmr()}}}}, {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKMassSpbcg]{\emph{\code{ARKMassSpbcg()}}}},
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKMassSptfqmr]{\emph{\code{ARKMassSptfqmr()}}}}, {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKMassPcg]{\emph{\code{ARKMassPcg()}}}} or
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKMassSpfgmr]{\emph{\code{ARKMassSpfgmr()}}}}, so it does not need to be supplied a second
time, unless the user wishes to change between \emph{mtimes} functions.

Iterative linear solver output routines are in the subsection
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-arkspilsoutputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Iterative linear solvers optional output functions}}}}.

\end{enumerate}

Following each table, we elaborate on each function.

Some of the optional outputs, especially the various counters, can be
very useful in determining the efficiency of various methods inside
the {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKode]{\emph{\code{ARKode()}}}} solver.  For example:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
The counters \emph{nsteps}, \emph{nfe\_evals} and \emph{nfi\_evals} provide a rough
measure of the overall cost of a given run, and can be compared
between runs with different solver options to suggest which set of
options is the most efficient.

\item {} 
The ratio \emph{nniters}/\emph{nsteps} measures the performance of the
nonlinear iteration in solving the nonlinear systems at each stage,
providing a measure of the degree of nonlinearity in the problem.
Typical values of this for a Newton solver on a general problem
range from 1.1 to 1.8.

\item {} 
When using a Newton nonlinear solver, the ratio \emph{njevals}/\emph{nniters}
(in the case of a direct linear solver), and the ratio
\emph{npevals}/\emph{nniters} (in the case of an iterative linear solver)
can measure the overall degree of nonlinearity in the problem,
since these are updated infrequently, unless the Newton method
convergence slows.

\item {} 
When using a Newton nonlinear solver, the ratio \emph{njevals}/\emph{nniters}
(when using a direct linear solver), and the ratio
\emph{nliters}/\emph{nniters} (when using an iterative linear solver) can
indicate the quality of the approximate Jacobian or preconditioner being
used.  For example, if this ratio is larger for a user-supplied
Jacobian or Jacobian-vector product routine than for the
difference-quotient routine, it can indicate that the user-supplied
Jacobian is inaccurate.

\item {} 
The ratio \emph{expsteps}/\emph{accsteps} can measure the quality of the ImEx
splitting used, since a higher-quality splitting will be dominated
by accuracy-limited steps.

\item {} 
The ratio \emph{nsteps}/\emph{step\_attempts} can measure the quality of the
time step adaptivity algorithm, since a poor algorithm will result
in more failed steps, and hence a lower ratio.

\end{itemize}

It is therefore recommended that users retrieve and output these
statistics following each run, and take some time to investigate
alternate solver options that will be more optimal for their
particular problem of interest.

\subsubsection{Iterative linear solvers optional output functions}
\label{c_interface/User_callable:iterative-linear-solvers-optional-output-functions}\label{c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-arkspilsoutputs}
The following optional outputs are available from the ARKSPILS
modules: workspace requirements, number of linear iterations, number
of linear convergence failures, number of calls to the preconditioner
setup and solve routines, number of calls to the Jacobian-vector
product routine, number of calls to the mass-matrix-vector
product routine, number of calls to the implicit right-hand side
routine for finite-difference Jacobian-vector product approximation,
and last return value from a linear solver function.  Note that, where
the name of an output would otherwise conflict with the name of an
optional output from the main solver, a suffix LS (for Linear Solver)
or MLS (for Mass Linear Solver) has been added here (e.g. \emph{lenrwLS}).

\subsection{ARKode reinitialization function}
\label{c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-reinitialization}\label{c_interface/User_callable:arkode-reinitialization-function}
The function {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeReInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeReInit()}}}} reinitializes the main ARKode
solver for the solution of a new problem, where a prior call to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeInit()}}}} has been made. The new problem must have the
same size as the previous one.  {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeReInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeReInit()}}}} performs the
same input checking and initializations that {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeInit()}}}}
does, but does no memory allocation as it assumes that the existing
internal memory is sufficient for the new problem.  A call to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeReInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeReInit()}}}} deletes the solution history that was stored
internally during the previous integration.  Following a successful
call to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeReInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeReInit()}}}}, call {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKode]{\emph{\code{ARKode()}}}} again for
the solution of the new problem.

The use of {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeReInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeReInit()}}}} requires that the number of Runge
Kutta stages, denoted by \emph{s}, be no larger for the new problem than
for the previous problem.  This condition is automatically fulfilled
if the method order \emph{q} and the problem type (explicit, implicit,
ImEx) are left unchanged.  If there are changes to the linear solver
specifications, the user should make the appropriate ARK*Set* calls,
as described in the section {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-linearsolvers]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Linear solver specification functions}}}}.
Otherwise, all solver inputs set previously remain in effect.

One important use of the {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeReInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeReInit()}}}} function is in the
treating of jump discontinuities in the RHS function.  Except in cases
of fairly small jumps, it is usually more efficient to stop at each
point of discontinuity and restart the integrator with a readjusted
ODE model, using a call to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeReInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeReInit()}}}}.  To stop when the
location of the discontinuity is known, simply make that location a
value of \code{tout}.  To stop when the location of the discontinuity is
determined by the solution, use the rootfinding feature.  In either
case, it is critical that the RHS function \emph{not} incorporate the
discontinuity, but rather have a smooth extention over the
discontinuity, so that the step across it (and subsequent rootfinding,
if used) can be done efficiently.  Then use a switch within the RHS
function (communicated through \code{user\_data}) that can be flipped
between the stopping of the integration and the restart, so that the
restarted problem uses the new values (which have jumped).  Similar
comments apply if there is to be a jump in the dependent variable
vector.

\subsection{ARKode system resize function}
\label{c_interface/User_callable:arkode-system-resize-function}\label{c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-resizing}
For simulations involving changes to the number of equations and
unknowns in the ODE system (e.g. when using spatially-adaptive
PDE simulations under a method-of-lines approach), the ARKode
integrator may be ``resized'' between integration steps, through calls
to the {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResize]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResize()}}}} function. This function modifies
ARKode's internal memory structures to use the new problem size,
without destruction of the temporal adaptivity heuristics.  It is
assumed that the dynamical time scales before and after the vector
resize will be comparable, so that all time-stepping heuristics prior
to calling {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResize]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResize()}}}} remain valid after the call.  If
instead the dynamics should be recomputed from scratch, the ARKode
memory structure should be deleted with a call to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeFree]{\emph{\code{ARKodeFree()}}}}, and recreated with calls to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeCreate]{\emph{\code{ARKodeCreate()}}}} and {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeInit()}}}}.

To aid in the vector resize operation, the user can supply a vector
resize function that will take as input a vector with the previous
size, and transform it in-place to return a corresponding vector of
the new size.  If this function (of type {\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKVecResizeFn]{\emph{\code{ARKVecResizeFn()}}}})
is not supplied (i.e. is set to \code{NULL}), then all existing vectors
internal to ARKode will be destroyed and re-cloned from the new input
vector.

In the case that the dynamical time scale should be modified slightly
from the previous time scale, an input \emph{hscale} is allowed, that will
rescale the upcoming time step by the specified factor.  If a value
\emph{hscale} \(\le 0\) is specified, the default of 1.0 will be used.

\end{fulllineitems}



\subsubsection{Resizing the linear solver}
\label{c_interface/User_callable:resizing-the-linear-solver}
When using any of the built-in linear solver modules, the linear
solver memory structures must also be resized.  At present, none of
these include a solver-specific `resize' function, so the linear
solver memory must be destroyed and re-allocated \textbf{following} each
call to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResize]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResize()}}}}.  For each of the built-in ARKDLS,
ARKSLS and ARKSPILS linear solvers, the specification call itself
(e.g. {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKDense]{\emph{\code{ARKDense()}}}} or {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSpgmr]{\emph{\code{ARKSpgmr()}}}}) will internally
destroy the solver-specific memory prior to re-allocation.

If any user-supplied routines are provided to aid the linear solver
(e.g. Jacobian construction, Jacobian-vector product,
mass-matrix-vector product, preconditioning), then the corresponding
``set'' routines must be called again \textbf{following} the solver
re-specification.


\subsubsection{Resizing the absolute tolerance array}
\label{c_interface/User_callable:resizing-the-absolute-tolerance-array}
If using array-valued absolute tolerances, the absolute tolerance
vector will be invalid after the call to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResize]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResize()}}}}, so
the new absolute tolerance vector should be re-set \textbf{following} each
call to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResize]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResize()}}}} through a new call to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSVtolerances]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSVtolerances()}}}} (and similarly to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResVtolerance]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResVtolerance()}}}} if that was used for the original
problem).

If scalar-valued tolerances or a tolerance function was specified
through either {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSStolerances]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSStolerances()}}}} or
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeWFtolerances]{\emph{\code{ARKodeWFtolerances()}}}}, then these will remain valid. and no
further action is necessary.

supplied serial C example problem, \code{ark\_heat1D\_adapt.c}.

\section{User-supplied functions}
\label{c_interface/User_supplied:cinterface-usersupplied}\label{c_interface/User_supplied:user-supplied-functions}\label{c_interface/User_supplied::doc}
The user-supplied functions for ARKode consist of:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
at least one function defining the ODE (required),

\item {} 
a function that handles error and warning messages (optional),

\item {} 
a function that provides the error weight vector (optional),

\item {} 
a function that provides the residual weight vector (optional),

\item {} 
a function that handles adaptive time step error control (optional),

\item {} 
a function that handles explicit time step stability (optional),

\item {} 
a function that defines the root-finding problem(s) to solve
(optional),

\item {} 
a function that provides Jacobian-related information for the linear
solver, if a Newton-based nonlinear iteration is chosen (optional),

\item {} 
one or two functions that define the preconditioner for use in any
of the Krylov iterative algorithms, if a Newton-based nonlinear
iteration and iterative linear solver are chosen (optional), and

\item {} 
if the problem involves a non-identity mass matrix \(M\ne I\):
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
a function that provides mass-matrix-related information for the
linear and mass matrix solvers (required),

\item {} 
one or two functions that define the mass matrix preconditioner
for use in an iterative mass matrix solver is chosen (optional), and

\end{itemize}

\item {} 
a function that handles vector resizing operations, if the
underlying vector structure supports resizing (as opposed to
deletion/recreation), and if the user plans to call
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResize]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResize()}}}} (optional).

\end{itemize}


\subsection{ODE right-hand side}
\label{c_interface/User_supplied:ode-right-hand-side}\label{c_interface/User_supplied:cinterface-oderhs}
The user must supply at least one function of type {\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKRhsFn]{\emph{\code{ARKRhsFn()}}}} to
specify the explicit and/or implicit portions of the ODE system:
\index{ARKRhsFn (C function)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKRhsFn}\pysiglinewithargsret{typedef int \bfcode{(*ARKRhsFn)}}{realtype\emph{ t}, N\_Vector\emph{ y}, N\_Vector\emph{ ydot}, void*\emph{ user\_data}}{}
These functions compute the ODE right-hand side for a given
value of the independent variable \(t\) and state vector \(y\).
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{t} -- the current value of the independent variable.

\item {} 
\emph{y} -- the current value of teh dependent variable vector, \(y(t)\).

\item {} 
\emph{ydot} -- the output vector that forms a portion of the ODE RHS \(f_E(t,y) + f_I(t,y)\).

\item {} 
\emph{user\_data} -- the \emph{user\_data} pointer that was passed to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetUserData]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetUserData()}}}}.

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Return value:}
An \emph{ARKRhsFn} should return 0 if successful, a positive value if a
recoverable error occurred (in which case ARKode will attempt to
correct), or a negative value if it failed unrecoverably (in which
case the integration is halted and \emph{ARK\_RHSFUNC\_FAIL} is returned).

\textbf{Notes:} Allocation of memory for \emph{ydot} is handled within
ARKode.  A recoverable failure error return from the \emph{ARKRhsFn} is
typically used to flag a value of the dependent variable \(y\)
that is ``illegal'' in some way (e.g., negative where only a
nonnegative value is physically meaningful).  If such a return is
made, ARKode will attempt to recover (possibly repeating the
nonlinear iteration, or reducing the step size) in order to avoid
this recoverable error return.  There are some situations in which
recovery is not possible even if the right-hand side function
returns a recoverable error flag.  One is when this occurs at the
very first call to the \emph{ARKRhsFn} (in which case
ARKode returns \emph{ARK\_FIRST\_RHSFUNC\_ERR}).  Another is when a
recoverable error is reported by \emph{ARKRhsFn} after the integrator
completes a successful stage, in which case ARKode returns
\emph{ARK\_UNREC\_RHSFUNC\_ERR}).

\subsection{Error message handler function}
\label{c_interface/User_supplied:cinterface-errorhandler}\label{c_interface/User_supplied:error-message-handler-function}
As an alternative to the default behavior of directing error and
warning messages to the file pointed to by \emph{errfp} (see
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetErrFile]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetErrFile()}}}}), the user may provide a function of type
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKErrHandlerFn]{\emph{\code{ARKErrHandlerFn()}}}} to process any such messages.
\index{ARKErrHandlerFn (C function)}

\begin{fulllineitems}

ARKode and is sub-modules.

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Return value:}
An \emph{ARKErrHandlerFn} function has no return value.

\textbf{Notes:} \emph{error\_code} is negative for errors and positive
(\emph{ARK\_WARNING}) for warnings.  If a function that returns a
pointer to memory encounters an error, it sets \emph{error\_code} to
0.

\end{fulllineitems}



\subsection{Error weight function}
\label{c_interface/User_supplied:cinterface-errorweight}\label{c_interface/User_supplied:error-weight-function}
As an alternative to providing the relative and absolute tolerances,
the user may provide a function of type {\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKEwtFn]{\emph{\code{ARKEwtFn()}}}} to compute a
vector \emph{ewt} containing the weights in the WRMS norm
\(\|v\|_{WRMS} = \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(ewt_i\; v_i\right)^2

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Return value:}
An \emph{ARKEwtFn} function must return 0 if it
successfully set the error weights, and -1 otherwise.

\textbf{Notes:} Allocation of memory for \emph{ewt} is handled within ARKode.

The error weight vector must have all components positive.  It is
the user's responsibility to perform this test and return -1 if it
is not satisfied.

\end{fulllineitems}



\subsection{Residual weight function}
\label{c_interface/User_supplied:cinterface-residualweight}\label{c_interface/User_supplied:residual-weight-function}
As an alternative to providing the scalar or vector absolute residual
tolerances (when the IVP units differ from the solution units), the
user may provide a function of type {\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKRwtFn]{\emph{\code{ARKRwtFn()}}}} to compute a
vector \emph{rwt} containing the weights in the WRMS norm
\(\|v\|_{WRMS} = \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left(rwt_i\; v_i\right)^2

\subsection{Time step adaptivity function}
\label{c_interface/User_supplied:time-step-adaptivity-function}\label{c_interface/User_supplied:cinterface-adaptivityfn}
As an alternative to using one of the built-in time step adaptivity
methods for controlling solution error, the user may provide a
function of type {\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKAdaptFn]{\emph{\code{ARKAdaptFn()}}}} to compute a target step size
\(h\) for the next integration step.  These steps should be chosen
as the maximum value such that the error estimates remain below 1.

\textbf{Return value:}
An \emph{ARKAdaptFn} function should return 0 if it
successfuly set the next step size, and a non-zero value otherwise.

\subsection{Explicit stability function}
\label{c_interface/User_supplied:explicit-stability-function}\label{c_interface/User_supplied:cinterface-stabilityfn}
A user may supply a function to predict the maximum stable step size
for the explicit portion of the ImEx system, \(f_E(t,y)\).  While
the accuracy-based time step adaptivity algorithms may be sufficient
for retaining a stable solution to the ODE system, these may be
inefficient if \(f_E(t,y)\) contains moderately stiff terms.  In
this scenario, a user may provide a function of type {\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKExpStabFn]{\emph{\code{ARKExpStabFn()}}}}
to provide this stability information to ARKode.  This function
must set the scalar step size satisfying the stability restriction for
the upcoming time step.  This value will subsequently be bounded by
the user-supplied values for the minimum and maximum allowed time
step, and the accuracy-based time step.

\textbf{Return value:}
An \emph{ARKExpStabFn} function should return 0 if it
successfully set the upcoming stable step size, and a non-zero
value otherwise.

\textbf{Notes:}  If this function is not supplied, or if it returns
\emph{hstab} \(\le 0.0\), then ARKode will assume that there is no explicit

the Jacobian approximation.

This function computes the dense Jacobian \(J =

\emph{tmp1}, \emph{tmp2}, \emph{tmp3} -- pointers to memory allocated to
variables of type \code{N\_Vector} which can be used by an
ARKDlsDenseJacFn as temporary storage or work space.

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Return value:}
An \emph{ARKDlsDenseJacFn} function should return 0 if
successful, a positive value if a recoverable error occurred (in
which case ARKode will attempt to correct, while ARKDENSE
sets \emph{last\_flag} to \emph{ARKDLS\_JACFUNC\_RECVR}), or a negative
value if it failed unrecoverably (in which case the integration is
halted, {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKode]{\emph{\code{ARKode()}}}} returns \emph{ARK\_LSETUP\_FAIL} and
ARKDENSE sets \emph{last\_flag} to \emph{ARKDLS\_JACFUNC\_UNRECVR}).

\textbf{Notes:} A user-supplied dense Jacobian function must load the
\emph{N} by \emph{N} dense matrix \emph{Jac} with an approximation to the Jacobian
matrix \(J(t,y)\) at the point \((t,y)\). Only nonzero
elements need to be loaded into \emph{Jac} because \emph{Jac} is set to
the zero matrix before the call to the Jacobian function. The type
of \emph{Jac} is \code{DlsMat}.

The accessor macros \code{DENSE\_ELEM} and \code{DENSE\_COL} allow the user
to read and write dense matrix elements without making explicit
references to the underlying representation of the \code{DlsMat}
type. \code{DENSE\_ELEM(J,i,j)} references the \code{(i,j)}-th element of
the dense matrix \code{J} (for \code{i}, \code{j} between 0 and
N-1). This macro is meant for small problems for which
efficiency of access is not a major concern. Thus, in terms of the
indices \(m\) and \(n\) ranging from 1 to \emph{N}, the
Jacobian element \(J_{m,n}\) can be set using the statement
\code{DENSE\_ELEM(J, m-1, n-1)} \(= J_{m,n}\). Alternatively,
\code{DENSE\_COL(J,j)} returns a pointer to the first element of the
\code{j}-th column of \code{J} (for \code{j} ranging from 0 to \emph{N}-1),
and the elements of the \code{j}-th column can then be accessed using
ordinary array indexing. Consequently, \(J_{m,n}\) can be
loaded using the statements \code{col\_n = DENSE\_COL(J, n-1);
col\_n{[}m-1{]}} \(= J_{m,n}\). For large problems, it is more
efficient to use \code{DENSE\_COL} than to use \code{DENSE\_ELEM}. Note
that both of these macros number rows and columns starting from 0.

The \code{DlsMat} type and accessor macros \code{DENSE\_ELEM} and
\code{DENSE\_COL} are documented in the section {\hyperref[linear_solvers/index:linearsolvers]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Linear Solvers in ARKode}}}}.

If the user's \emph{ARKDlsDenseJacFn} function uses difference quotient
approximations, then it may need to access quantities not in the
argument list. These include the current step size, the error
weights, etc.  To obtain these, the user will need to add a pointer
to the \code{ark\_mem} structure to their \code{user\_data}, and then use
the ARKodeGet* functions listed in
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionaloutputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional output functions}}}}. The unit roundoff can be
accessed as \code{UNIT\_ROUNDOFF}, which is defined in the header
file \code{sundials\_types.h}.

For the sake of uniformity, the argument \emph{N} is of type \code{long int},
even in the case that the LAPACK dense solver is to be used.

in Step 8 of the section {\hyperref[c_interface/Skeleton:cinterface-skeleton]{\emph{\DUspan{}{A skeleton of the user's main program}}}}), the user may

This function computes the banded Jacobian \(J =

variables of type \code{N\_Vector} which can be used by an
ARKDlsBandJacFn as temporary storage or work space.

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Return value:}
An \emph{ARKDlsBandJacFn} function should return 0 if
successful, a positive value if a recoverable error occurred (in
which case ARKode will attempt to correct, while ARKBAND
sets \emph{last\_flag} to \emph{ARKDLS\_JACFUNC\_RECVR}), or a negative
value if it failed unrecoverably (in which case the integration is
halted, {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKode]{\emph{\code{ARKode()}}}} returns \emph{ARK\_LSETUP\_FAIL} and
ARKBAND sets \emph{last\_flag} to \emph{ARKDLS\_JACFUNC\_UNRECVR}).

\textbf{Notes:} A user-supplied banded Jacobian function must load the band
matrix \emph{Jac} of type \code{DlsMat} with the elements of the Jacobian
\(J(t,y)\) at the point \((t,y)\). Only nonzero elements
need to be loaded into \emph{Jac} because \emph{Jac} is initialized to
the zero matrix before the call to the Jacobian function.

The accessor macros \code{BAND\_ELEM}, \code{BAND\_COL}, and
\code{BAND\_COL\_ELEM} allow the user to read and write band matrix
elements without making specific references to the underlying
representation of the \code{DlsMat} type.  \code{BAND\_ELEM(J, i, j)}
references the \code{(i,j)}-th element of the band matrix \code{J},
counting from 0. This macro is meant for use in small problems for
which efficiency of access is not a major concern. Thus, in terms
of the indices \(m\) and \(n\) ranging from 1 to \emph{N} with
\((m, n)\) within the band defined by \emph{mupper} and
\emph{mlower}, the Jacobian element \(J_{m,n}\) can be loaded
using the statement \code{BAND\_ELEM(J, m-1, n-1)} \(=
J_{m,n}\). The elements within the band are those with \emph{-mupper}
\(\le m-n \le\) \emph{mlower}.  Alternatively, \code{BAND\_COL(J, j)}
returns a pointer to the diagonal element of the \code{j}-th column of
\code{J}, and if we assign this address to \code{realtype *col\_j}, then
the \code{i}-th element of the \code{j}-th column is given by
\code{BAND\_COL\_ELEM(col\_j, i, j)}, counting from 0. Thus, for
\((m,n)\) within the band, \(J_{m,n}\) can be loaded by
setting \code{col\_n = BAND\_COL(J, n-1); BAND\_COL\_ELEM(col\_n, m-1,
n-1)} \(= J_{m,n}\) . The elements of the \code{j}-th column can
also be accessed via ordinary array indexing, but this approach
requires knowledge of the underlying storage for a band matrix of
type \code{DlsMat}. The array \code{col\_n} can be indexed from
\emph{-mupper} to \emph{mlower}. For large problems, it is more efficient
to use \code{BAND\_COL} and \code{BAND\_COL\_ELEM} than to use the
\code{BAND\_ELEM} macro. As in the dense case, these macros all number
rows and columns starting from 0.

The \code{DlsMat} type and the accessor macros \code{BAND\_ELEM},
\code{BAND\_COL} and \code{BAND\_COL\_ELEM} are documented in the section
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/index:linearsolvers]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Linear Solvers in ARKode}}}}.

If the user's \emph{ARKDlsBandJacFn} function uses difference quotient
approximations, then it may need to access quantities not in the

An \emph{ARKSlsSparseJacFn} function should return 0 if

compressed-sparse-column (CSC) or compressed-sparse-row (CSR)
matrix \emph{Jac} with an approximation to the Jacobian matrix
\(J(t,y)\) at the point \((t,y)\).  Storage for \emph{Jac}
already exists on entry to this function, although the user should
ensure that sufficient space is allocated in \emph{Jac} to hold the
nonzero values to be set; if the existing space is insufficient the
user may reallocate the data and row index arrays as needed.  The
type of \emph{Jac} is \code{SlsMat}, and the amount of allocated space is
available within the \code{SlsMat} structure as \code{NNZ}. The
\code{SlsMat} type is further documented in the section
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/index:linearsolvers]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Linear Solvers in ARKode}}}}.

If the user's \emph{ARKSlsSparseJacFn} function uses difference quotient
approximations to set the specific matrix entries, then it may need
to access quantities not in the argument list.  These include the
current step size, the error weights, etc..  To obtain these, the

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Return value:}
The value to be returned by the preconditioner setup
function is a flag indicating whether it was successful. This value
should be 0 if successful, positive for a recoverable error (in
which case the step will be retried), or negative for an
unrecoverable error (in which case the integration is halted).

\textbf{Notes:}  The operations performed by this function might include
forming a crude approximate Jacobian, and performing an LU
factorization of the resulting approximation to \(A = M -
\gamma J\).

Each call to the preconditioner setup function is preceded by a
call to the implicit {\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKRhsFn]{\emph{\code{ARKRhsFn()}}}} user function with the same
\((t,y)\) arguments.  Thus, the preconditioner setup function can
use any auxiliary data that is computed and saved during the
evaluation of the ODE right-hand side.

This function is not called in advance of every call to the
preconditioner solve function, but rather is called only as often
as needed to achieve convergence in the Newton iteration.

If the user's \emph{ARKSpilsPrecSetupFn} function uses difference
quotient approximations, it may need to access quantities not in
the call list. These include the current step size, the error
weights, etc..  To obtain these, the user will need to add a
pointer to the \code{ark\_mem} structure to their \code{user\_data}, and
then use the ARKodeGet* functions listed in
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionaloutputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional output functions}}}}. The unit roundoff can be
accessed as \code{UNIT\_ROUNDOFF}, which is defined in the header
file \code{sundials\_types.h}.

\textbf{Notes:}  The operations performed by this function might include
forming a mass matrix and performing an incomplete
factorization of the result.  Although such operations would
typically be performed only once at the beginning of a simulation,
these may be required if the mass matrix can change as a function
of time.

\subsection{Vector resize function}
\label{c_interface/User_supplied:cinterface-vecresizefn}\label{c_interface/User_supplied:vector-resize-function}
For simulations involving changes to the number of equations and
unknowns in the ODE system (e.g. when using spatial adaptivity in a
PDE simulation), the ARKode integrator may be ``resized'' between
integration steps, through calls to the {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResize]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResize()}}}}
function. Typically, when performing adaptive simulations the solution
is stored in a customized user-supplied data structure, to enable
adaptivity without repeated allocation/deallocation of memory.  In
these scenarios, it is recommended that the user supply a customized
vector kernel to interface between SUNDIALS and their problem-specific
data structure.  If this vector kernel includes a function to resize a
given vector, then this function may be supplied to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResize]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResize()}}}} so that all internal ARKode vectors may be
resized, instead of deleting and re-creating them at each call.  This
resize function should have the following form:
\index{ARKVecResizeFn (C function)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKVecResizeFn}\pysiglinewithargsret{typedef int \bfcode{(*ARKVecResizeFn)}}{N\_Vector\emph{ y}, N\_Vector\emph{ ytemplate}, void*\emph{ user\_data}}{}
This function resizes the vector \emph{y} to match the dimensions of the
supplied vector, \emph{ytemplate}.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}

\emph{resize\_data} parameter that was passed to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResize]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResize()}}}}.

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Return value:}
An \emph{ARKVecResizeFn} function should return 0 if it successfully
resizes the vector \emph{y}, and a non-zero value otherwise.

\textbf{Notes:}  If this function is not supplied, then ARKode will
instead destroy the vector \emph{y} and clone a new vector \emph{y} off of
\emph{ytemplate}.

\section{Preconditioner modules}
\label{c_interface/Preconditioners::doc}\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:cinterface-preconditionermodules}\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:preconditioner-modules}
The efficiency of Krylov iterative methods for the solution of linear
systems can be greatly enhanced through preconditioning.  For problems
in which the user cannot define a more effective, problem-specific
preconditioner, ARKode provides two internal preconditioner modules:
a banded preconditioner for serial problems (ARKBANDPRE) and a
band-block-diagonal preconditioner  for parallel problems (ARKBBDPRE).


\subsection{A serial banded preconditioner module}
\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:cinterface-bandpre}\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:a-serial-banded-preconditioner-module}
This preconditioner provides a band matrix preconditioner for use with
any of the Krylov iterative linear solvers.  It requires that the
problem be set up using either the NVECTOR\_SERIAL, NVECTOR\_OPENMP or
NVECTOR\_PTHREADS module, due to data access patterns.  It uses
difference quotients of the ODE right-hand side function \(f_I\)
to generate a band matrix of bandwidth \code{ml + mu + 1}, where the
number of super-diagonals (\code{mu}, the upper half-bandwidth) and
sub-diagonals (\code{ml}, the lower half-bandwidth) are specified by the
user.  This band matrix is used to to form a preconditioner the Krylov
linear solver.  Although this matrix is intended to approximate the
Jacobian \(J = \frac{\partial f_I}{\partial y}\), it may be a
very crude approximation, since the true Jacobian may not be banded,
or its true bandwidth may be larger than \code{ml + mu + 1}.  However, as
long as the banded approximation generated for the preconditioner is
sufficiently accurate, it may speed convergence of the Krylov
iteration.


\subsubsection{ARKBANDPRE usage}
\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:arkbandpre-usage}
In order to use the ARKBANDPRE module, the user need not define
any additional functions.  In addition to the header files required
for the remainder of the ODE problem (see the section
{\hyperref[c_interface/General:cinterface-headers]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Access to library and header files}}}}), to use the ARKBANDPRE module, the user's
program must include the header file \code{arkode\_bandpre.h} which
declares the needed function prototypes.  The following is a summary
of the usage of this module.  Steps that are unchanged from the
skeleton program presented in {\hyperref[c_interface/Skeleton:cinterface-skeleton]{\emph{\DUspan{}{A skeleton of the user's main program}}}} are
\emph{italicized}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
\emph{Set problem dimensions}

\item {} 
\emph{Set vector of initial values}

\item {} 
\emph{Create ARKode object}

\item {} 
\emph{Initialize ARKode solver}

\item {} 
\emph{Specify integration tolerances}

\item {} 
\emph{Set optional inputs}

\item {} 
Attach iterative linear solver module, one of:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\code{ier = ARKSpgmr(...);}

\item {} 
\code{ier = ARKSpbcg(...);}

\item {} 
\code{ier = ARKSptfqmr(...);}

\item {} 
\code{ier = ARKSpfgmr(...);}

\item {} 
\code{ier = ARKPcg(...);}

\end{itemize}

\item {} 
Initialize the ARKBANDPRE preconditioner module

Specify the upper and lower half-bandwidths (\code{mu} and \code{ml},
respectively) and call

\code{ier = ARKBandPrecInit(arkode\_mem, N, mu, ml);}

to allocate memory and initialize the internal preconditioner
data.

\item {} 
\emph{Set linear solver optional inputs}

Note that the user should not overwrite the preconditioner setup
function or solve function through calls to the ARKSpilsSet*
optional input functions.

\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{9}
\item {} 
\emph{Specify rootfinding problem}

\item {} 
\emph{Advance solution in time}

\item {} 
Get optional outputs

Additional optional outputs associated with ARKBANDPRE are
available by way of the two routines described below,
{\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKBandPrecGetWorkSpace]{\emph{\code{ARKBandPrecGetWorkSpace()}}}} and
{\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKBandPrecGetNumRhsEvals]{\emph{\code{ARKBandPrecGetNumRhsEvals()}}}}.

\item {} 
\emph{Free solver memory}

\item {} 
\emph{Deallocate memory for solution vector}

\end{enumerate}

We note that at present, the ARKBANDPRE preconditioner may not be
used for problems involving a non-identity mass matrix, \(M\ne
I\), although support for this is planned for the near future.


\subsubsection{ARKBANDPRE user-callable functions}
\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:arkbandpre-user-callable-functions}
The ARKBANDPRE preconditioner module is initialized and attached
by calling the following function:

\subsection{A parallel band-block-diagonal preconditioner module}
\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:cinterface-bbdpre}\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:a-parallel-band-block-diagonal-preconditioner-module}
A principal reason for using a parallel ODE solver (such as ARKode)
lies in the solution of partial differential equations
(PDEs). Moreover, Krylov iterative methods are used on many such
problems due to the nature of the underlying linear system of
equations that needs to solved at each time step.  For many PDEs, the
linear algebraic system is large, sparse and structured.  However, if
a Krylov iterative method is to be effective in this setting, then a
nontrivial preconditioner is required.  Otherwise, the rate of
convergence of the Krylov iterative method is usually slow, and
degrades as the PDE mesh is refined.  Typically, an effective
preconditioner must be problem-specific.  However, we have developed
one type of preconditioner that treats a rather broad class of
PDE-based problems.  It has been successfully used with CVODE for
several realistic, large-scale problems \phantomsection\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:id1}{\hyperref[References:ht1998]{\emph{{[}HT1998{]}}}} and is included
in a software module within the ARKode package.  This module works
with the parallel vector module NVECTOR\_PARALLEL and is usable
with any of the Krylov iterative linear solvers. It generates a
preconditioner that is a block-diagonal matrix with each block being a
band matrix. The blocks need not have the same number of super- and
sub-diagonals and these numbers may vary from block to block. This
Band-Block-Diagonal Preconditioner module is called ARKBBDPRE.

One way to envision these preconditioners is to think of the
computational PDE domain as being subdivided into \(Q\)
non-overlapping subdomains, where each subdomain is assigned to one of
the \(Q\) MPI tasks used to solve the ODE system.  The basic idea
is to isolate the preconditioning so that it is local to each process,
and also to use a (possibly cheaper) approximate right-hand side
function for construction of this preconditioning matrix.  This
requires the definition of a new function \(g(t,y) \approx
f_I(t,y)\) that will be used to construct the BBD preconditioner
matrix.  As with the rest of ARKode, we assume here that the ODE
system is written as
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}M\dot{y} = f_E(t,y) + f_I(t,y),\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where \(f_I\) corresponds to the ODE components to be treated
implicitly.  The user may set \(g = f_I\), if no less expensive
approximation is desired.

Corresponding to the domain decomposition, there is a decomposition of
the solution vector \(y\) into \(Q\) disjoint blocks
\(y_q\), and a decomposition of \(g\) into blocks
\(g_q\). The block \(g_q\) depends both on \(y_p\) and on
components of blocks \(y_{q'}\) associated with neighboring
subdomains (so-called ghost-cell data).  If we let \(\bar{y}_q\)
denote \(y_q\) augmented with those other components on which
\(g_q\) depends, then we have
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}g(t,y) = \left[ g_1(t,\bar{y}_1), g_2(t,\bar{y}_2), \ldots , g_Q(t,\bar{y}_Q) \right]^T,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
and each of the blocks \(g_q(t,\bar{y}_q)\) is decoupled from one another.

The preconditioner associated with this decomposition has the form
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}P = \text{diag}[P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_Q]\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}P_q \approx M - \gamma J_q\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
and where \(J_q\) is a difference quotient approximation to
\(\frac{\partial g_q}{\partial \bar{y}_q}\).  This matrix is taken
to be banded, with upper and lower half-bandwidths \emph{mudq} and
\emph{mldq} defined as the number of non-zero diagonals above and below
the main diagonal, respectively.  The difference quotient
approximation is computed using \emph{mudq} + \emph{mldq} + 2 evaluations of
\(g_m\), but only a matrix of bandwidth \emph{mukeep} + \emph{mlkeep} + 1 is
retained. Neither pair of parameters need be the true half-bandwidths
of the Jacobian of the local block of \(g\), if smaller values
provide a more efficient preconditioner. The solution of the complete
linear system
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}Px = b\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
reduces to solving each of the distinct equations
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}P_q x_q = b_q, \quad q=1,\ldots,Q,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
and this is done by banded LU factorization of \(P_q\) followed by
a banded backsolve.

Similar block-diagonal preconditioners could be considered with
different treatments of the blocks \(P_q\).  For example,
incomplete LU factorization or an iterative method could be used
instead of banded LU factorization.


\subsubsection{ARKBBDPRE user-supplied functions}
\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:arkbbdpre-user-supplied-functions}
The ARKBBDPRE module calls two user-provided functions to construct
\(P\): a required function \emph{gloc} (of type {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKLocalFn]{\emph{\code{ARKLocalFn()}}}})
which approximates the right-hand side function \(g(t,y) \approx
f_I(t,y)\) and which is computed locally, and an optional function
\emph{cfn} (of type {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKCommFn]{\emph{\code{ARKCommFn()}}}}) which performs all interprocess
communication necessary to evaluate the approximate right-hand side
\(g\). These are in addition to the user-supplied right-hand side
function \(f_I\). Both functions take as input the same pointer
\emph{user\_data} that is passed by the user to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetUserData]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetUserData()}}}} and that was passed to the user's
function \(f_I\). The user is responsible for providing space
(presumably within \emph{user\_data}) for components of \(y\) that are
communicated between processes by \emph{cfn}, and that are then used by
\emph{gloc}, which should not do any communication.
\index{ARKLocalFn (C function)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKLocalFn}\pysiglinewithargsret{typedef int \bfcode{(*ARKLocalFn)}}{long int\emph{ Nlocal}, realtype\emph{ t}, N\_Vector\emph{ y}, N\_Vector\emph{ glocal}, void*\emph{ user\_data}}{}
This \emph{gloc} function computes \(g(t,y)\).  It
fills the vector \emph{glocal} as a function of \emph{t} and \emph{y}.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{Nlocal} -- the local vector length

\item {}

\item {} 
\emph{glocal} -- the output vector of \(g(t,y)\) on this process

\item {} 
\emph{user\_data} -- a pointer to user data, the same as the
\emph{user\_data} parameter passed to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetUserData]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetUserData()}}}}.

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Return value:}
An \emph{ARKLocalFn} should return 0 if successful, a positive value if
a recoverable error occurred (in which case ARKode will attempt to
correct), or a negative value if it failed unrecoverably (in which
case the integration is halted and {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKode]{\emph{\code{ARKode()}}}} will return
\emph{ARK\_LSETUP\_FAIL}).

\textbf{Notes:}  This function should assume that all interprocess
communication of data needed to calculate \emph{glocal} has already been
done, and that this data is accessible within user data.

The case where \(g\) is mathematically identical to \(f_I\)
is allowed.

\end{fulllineitems}

\index{ARKCommFn (C function)}

\begin{fulllineitems}

This \emph{cfn} function performs all interprocess
communication necessary for the executation of the \emph{gloc} function
above, using the input vector \emph{y}.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}

\emph{user\_data} -- a pointer to user data, the same as the
\emph{user\_data} parameter passed to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetUserData]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetUserData()}}}}.

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Return value:}
An \emph{ARKCommFn} should return 0 if successful, a positive value if a
recoverable error occurred (in which case ARKode will attempt to
correct), or a negative value if it failed unrecoverably (in which
case the integration is halted and {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKode]{\emph{\code{ARKode()}}}} will return
\emph{ARK\_LSETUP\_FAIL}).

\textbf{Notes:}  The \emph{cfn} function is expected to save communicated data in
space defined within the data structure \emph{user\_data}.

Each call to the \emph{cfn} function is preceded by a call to the
right-hand side function \(f_I\) with the same \((t,y)\)
arguments. Thus, \emph{cfn} can omit any communication done by
\(f_I\) if relevant to the evaluation of \emph{glocal}. If all
necessary communication was done in \(f_I\), then \emph{cfn} =
\code{NULL} can be passed in the call to {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKBBDPrecInit]{\emph{\code{ARKBBDPrecInit()}}}}
(see below).

\subsubsection{ARKBBDPRE usage}
\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:arkbbdpre-usage}
In addition to the header files required for the integration of the
ODE problem (see the section {\hyperref[c_interface/General:cinterface-headers]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Access to library and header files}}}}), to use the
ARKBBDPRE module, the user's program must include the header file
\code{arkode\_bbdpre.h} which declares the needed function prototypes.

The following is a summary of the proper usage of this module. Steps
that are unchanged from the skeleton program presented in
{\hyperref[c_interface/Skeleton:cinterface-skeleton]{\emph{\DUspan{}{A skeleton of the user's main program}}}} are \emph{italicized}.

\code{ier = ARKBBDPrecInit(arkode\_mem, Nlocal, mudq, mldq, mukeep, mlkeep, dqrely, gloc, cfn);}

to allocate memory and initialize the internal preconditioner
data. The last two arguments of {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKBBDPrecInit]{\emph{\code{ARKBBDPrecInit()}}}} are the
two user-supplied functions of type {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKLocalFn]{\emph{\code{ARKLocalFn()}}}} and
{\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKCommFn]{\emph{\code{ARKCommFn()}}}} described above, respectivelyl.

\item {} 
\emph{Set the linear solver optional inputs}

input functions.

\end{enumerate}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{10}
\item {} 
\emph{Specify rootfinding problem}

\item {} 
\emph{Advance solution in time}

\item {} 
\emph{Get optional outputs}

Additional optional outputs associated with ARKBBDPRE are
available through the routines
{\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKBBDPrecGetWorkSpace]{\emph{\code{ARKBBDPrecGetWorkSpace()}}}} and
{\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKBBDPrecGetNumGfnEvals]{\emph{\code{ARKBBDPrecGetNumGfnEvals()}}}}.

\item {} 
\emph{Free solver memory}

\item {} 
\emph{Deallocate memory for solution vector}

\item {} 
\emph{Finalize MPI}

\end{enumerate}

We note that at present, the ARKBBDPRE preconditioner may not be used
for problems involving a non-identity mass matrix, \(M\ne I\),
although support for this is planned for the near future.


\subsubsection{ARKBBDPRE user-callable functions}
\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:arkbbdpre-user-callable-functions}
The ARKBBDPRE preconditioner module is initialized (or re-initialized)
and attached to the integrator by calling the following functions:
\index{ARKBBDPrecInit (C function)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKBBDPrecInit}\pysiglinewithargsret{int \bfcode{ARKBBDPrecInit}}{void*\emph{ arkode\_mem}, long int\emph{ Nlocal}, long int\emph{ mudq}, long int\emph{ mldq}, long int\emph{ mukeep}, long int\emph{ mlkeep}, realtype\emph{ dqrely}, {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKLocalFn]{\emph{ARKLocalFn}}}\emph{ gloc}, {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKCommFn]{\emph{ARKCommFn}}}\emph{ cfn}}{}
Initializes and allocates (internal) memory for the
ARKBBDPRE preconditioner.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{arkode\_mem} -- pointer to the ARKode memory block.

\item {} 
\emph{Nlocal} -- local vector length.

\item {} 
\emph{mudq} -- upper half-bandwidth to be used in the difference
quotient Jacobian approximation.

\item {} 
\emph{mldq} -- lower half-bandwidth to be used in the difference
quotient Jacobian approximation.

\item {} 
\emph{mukeep} -- upper half-bandwidth of the retained banded
approximate Jacobian block.

\item {} 
\emph{mlkeep} -- lower half-bandwidth of the retained banded
approximate Jacobian block.

\item {} 
\emph{dqrely} -- the relative increment in components of \emph{y} used in
the difference quotient approximations.  The default is \emph{dqrely}
= \(\sqrt{\text{unit roundoff}}\), which can be specified by
passing \emph{dqrely} = 0.0.

\item {} 
\emph{gloc} -- the name of the C function (of type {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKLocalFn]{\emph{\code{ARKLocalFn()}}}})
which computes the approximation \(g(t,y) \approx f_I(t,y)\).

\item {} 
\emph{cfn} -- the name of the C function (of type {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKCommFn]{\emph{\code{ARKCommFn()}}}}) which
performs all interprocess communication required for the
computation of \(g(t,y)\).

\end{itemize}

\item[{\textbf{Return value:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{ARKSPILS\_SUCCESS} if no errors occurred

\item {} 
\emph{ARKSPILS\_MEM\_NULL} if the integrator memory is \code{NULL}

\item {} 
\emph{ARKSPILS\_LMEM\_NULL} if the linear solver memory is \code{NULL}

\item {} 
\emph{ARKSPILS\_ILL\_INPUT} if an input has an illegal value

\item {} 
\emph{ARKSPILS\_MEM\_FAIL} if a memory allocation request failed

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Notes:}  If one of the half-bandwidths \emph{mudq} or \emph{mldq} to be used
in the difference quotient calculation of the approximate Jacobian is
negative or exceeds the value \emph{Nlocal}-1, it is replaced by 0 or
\emph{Nlocal}-1 accordingly.

The half-bandwidths \emph{mudq} and \emph{mldq} need not be the true
half-bandwidths of the Jacobian of the local block of \(g\)
when smaller values may provide a greater efficiency.

Also, the half-bandwidths \emph{mukeep} and \emph{mlkeep} of the retained
banded approximate Jacobian block may be even smaller than
\emph{mudq} and \emph{mldq}, to reduce storage and computational costs
further.

For all four half-bandwidths, the values need not be the same on
every processor.

\end{fulllineitems}


The ARKBBDPRE module also provides a reinitialization function to
allow solving a sequence of problems of the same size, with the same
linear solver choice, provided there is no change in \emph{Nlocal},
\emph{mukeep}, or \emph{mlkeep}. After solving one problem, and after
calling {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeReInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeReInit()}}}} to re-initialize ARKode for a
subsequent problem, a call to {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKBBDPrecReInit]{\emph{\code{ARKBBDPrecReInit()}}}} can be made
to change any of the following: the half-bandwidths \emph{mudq} and
\emph{mldq} used in the difference-quotient Jacobian approximations, the
relative increment \emph{dqrely}, or one of the user-supplied functions
\emph{gloc} and \emph{cfn}. If there is a change in any of the linear solver
inputs, an additional call to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSpgmr]{\emph{\code{ARKSpgmr()}}}},
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSpbcg]{\emph{\code{ARKSpbcg()}}}}, {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSptfqmr]{\emph{\code{ARKSptfqmr()}}}}, {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKSpfgmr]{\emph{\code{ARKSpfgmr()}}}},
or {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKPcg]{\emph{\code{ARKPcg()}}}}, and/or one or more of the corresponding
ARKSpilsSet* functions, must also be made (in the proper order).

\chapter{FARKODE, an Interface Module for FORTRAN Applications}
\label{f_interface/index:farkode-an-interface-module-for-fortran-applications}\label{f_interface/index:fortraninterface}\label{f_interface/index::doc}
The FARKODE interface module is a package of C functions which
support the use of the ARKODE solver for the solution of ODE
systems
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}M \dot{y} = f_E(t,y) + f_I(t,y),\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
in a mixed Fortran/C setting.  While ARKODE is written in C, it is
assumed here that the user's calling program and user-supplied
problem-defining routines are written in Fortran. This package
provides the necessary interfaces to ARKODE for all supplied serial
and parallel NVECTOR implementations.


\section{Important note on portability}
\label{f_interface/index:important-note-on-portability}\label{f_interface/index:finterface-portability}
In this package, the names of the interface functions, and the names
of the Fortran user routines called by them, appear as dummy names
which are mapped to actual values by a series of definitions in the
header files.  By default, those mapping definitions depend in turn
on the C macro \code{F77\_FUNC} defined in the header file
\code{sundials\_config.h}.  The mapping defined by \code{F77\_FUNC} in turn
transforms the C interface names to match the name-mangling approach
used by the supplied Fortran compiler.

By ``name-mangling'', we mean that due to the case-independent nature of
the Fortran language, Fortran compilers convert all subroutine and
object names to use either all lower-case or all upper-case
characters, and append either zero, one or two underscores as a prefix
or suffix the the name.  For example, the Fortran subroutine
\code{MyFunction()} will be changed to one of \code{myfunction},
\code{MYFUNCTION}, \code{myfunction\_\_}, \code{MYFUNCTION\_}, and so on,
depending on the Fortran compiler used.

SUNDIALS determines this name-mangling scheme at configuration time
(see {\hyperref[Install:installation]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode Installation Procedure}}}}).


\section{Fortran Data Types}
\label{f_interface/index:fortran-data-types}\label{f_interface/index:finterface-datatypes}
Throughout this documentation, we will refer to data types according
to their usage in C.  The equivalent types to these may vary,
depending on your computer architecture and on how SUNDIALS was
compiled (see {\hyperref[Install:installation]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode Installation Procedure}}}}).  A Fortran user should first
determine the equivalent types for their architecture and compiler,
and then take care that all arguments passed through this Fortran/C
interface are declared of the appropriate type.

\textbf{Integers}: SUNDIALS uses both \code{int} and \code{long int} types:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\code{int} -- equivalent to an \code{INTEGER} or \code{INTEGER*4} in Fortran

\item {} 
\code{long int} -- this will depend on the computer architecture:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
32-bit architecture -- equivalent to an \code{INTEGER} or \code{INTEGER*4} in Fortran

\item {} 
64-bit architecture -- equivalent to an \code{INTEGER*8} in Fortran

\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Real numbers}:  As discussed in {\hyperref[Install:installation]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode Installation Procedure}}}}, at compilation
SUNDIALS allows the configuration option  \code{-{-}with-precision},
that accepts values of \code{single}, \code{double} or \code{extended} (the
default is \code{double}).  This choice dictates the size of a
\code{realtype} variable.  The corresponding Fortran types for these
\code{realtype} sizes are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\code{single} -- equivalent to a \code{REAL} or \code{REAL*4} in Fortran

\item {} 
\code{double} -- equivalent to a \code{DOUBLE PRECISION} or \code{REAL*8} in Fortran

\item {} 
\code{extended} -- equivalent to a \code{REAL*16} in Fortran

\end{itemize}

Details on the Fortran interface to ARKode are provided in the
following sub-sections:


\subsection{FARKODE routines}
\label{f_interface/Routines:finterface-routines}\label{f_interface/Routines::doc}\label{f_interface/Routines:farkode-routines}
In this section, we list the full set of user-callable functions
comprising the FARKODE solver interface.  For each function, we list
the corresponding ARKode functions, to provide a mapping between the
two solver interfaces.  Further documentation on each FARKODE function
is provided in the following sections, {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:finterface-usage]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Usage of the FARKODE interface module}}}},

\subsubsection{User-supplied routines}
\label{f_interface/Routines:finterface-usersupplied}\label{f_interface/Routines:user-supplied-routines}
As with the native C interface, the FARKode solver interface requires
user-supplied functions to specify the ODE problem to be solved.  In
contrast to the case of direct use of ARKode, and of most Fortran ODE
solvers, the names of all user-supplied routines here are fixed, in
order to maximize portability for the resulting mixed-language program.
As a result, whether using a purely implicit, purely explicit, or
mixed implicit-explicit solver, routines for both \(f_E(t,y)\) and
\(f_I(t,y)\) must be provided by the user (though either of which
may do nothing):

\begin{tabulary}{\linewidth}{|L|L|}
\hline
\textsf{\relax 
FARKODE routine
(FORTRAN, user-supplied)
} & \textsf{\relax 
ARKode interface
function type
}\\
\hline
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKIFUN]{\emph{\code{FARKIFUN()}}}}

 & 
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKRhsFn]{\emph{\code{ARKRhsFn()}}}}
\\
\hline\end{tabulary}


In addition, as with the native C interface a user may provide
additional routines to assist in the solution process.  Each of the
following user-supplied routines is activated by calling the specified
``activation'' routine, with the exception of {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPJAC]{\emph{\code{FARKSPJAC()}}}}
which is required whenever a sparse matrix solver is used:

\subsection{Usage of the FARKODE interface module}
\label{f_interface/Usage:finterface-usage}\label{f_interface/Usage::doc}\label{f_interface/Usage:usage-of-the-farkode-interface-module}
The usage of FARKODE requires calls to six or more interface
functions, depending on the method options selected, and two or more
user-supplied routines which define the problem to be solved.  These
function calls and user routines are summarized separately below.
Some details are omitted, and the user is referred to the description
of the corresponding C interface ARKode functions for complete
information on the arguments of any given user-callable interface
routine, or of a given user-supplied function called by an interface
function.  The usage of FARKODE for rootfinding and with
preconditioner modules is described in later subsections.


\subsubsection{Right-hand side specification}
\label{f_interface/Usage:right-hand-side-specification}\label{f_interface/Usage:finterface-rhs}
The user must in all cases supply the following Fortran routines:
\index{FARKIFUN() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKIFUN}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKIFUN}}{\emph{T}, \emph{Y}, \emph{YDOT}, \emph{IPAR}, \emph{RPAR}, \emph{IER}}{}
Sets the \emph{YDOT} array to \(f_I(t,y)\), the implicit portion of
the right-hand side of the ODE system, as function of the
independent variable \emph{T} \(=t\) and the array of dependent state
variables \emph{Y} \(=y\).
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{T} (\code{realtype}, input) -- current value of the independent variable.

\item {} 
\emph{Y} (\code{realtype}, input) -- array containing state variables.

\item {} 
\emph{YDOT} (\code{realtype}, output) -- array containing state derivatives.

\item {} 
\emph{IPAR} (\code{long int}, input) -- array containing integer user

\item {} 
\emph{IER} (\code{int}, output) -- return flag (0 success, \textgreater{}0
recoverable error, \textless{}0 unrecoverable error).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\end{fulllineitems}

Sets the \emph{YDOT} array to \(f_E(t,y)\), the explicit portion of
the right-hand side of the ODE system, as function of the
independent variable \emph{T} \(=t\) and the array of dependent state
variables \emph{Y} \(=y\).
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}

\emph{IER} (\code{int}, output) -- return flag (0 success, \textgreater{}0
recoverable error, \textless{}0 unrecoverable error).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\end{fulllineitems}


For purely explicit problems, although the routine
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKIFUN]{\emph{\code{FARKIFUN()}}}} must exist, it will never be called, and may
remain empty.  Similarly, for purely implicit problems,
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKEFUN]{\emph{\code{FARKEFUN()}}}} will never be called and must exist and may
remain empty.


\subsubsection{NVECTOR module initialization}
\label{f_interface/Usage:nvector-module-initialization}\label{f_interface/Usage:finterface-nvector}
If using one of teh NVECTOR modules supplied with SUNDIALS, the user
must make a call of the form

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{n}{CALL} \PYG{n}{FNVINIT}\PYG{o}{*}\PYG{o}{*}\PYG{o}{*}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{p}{.}\PYG{p}{)}
\end{Verbatim}

in which the name and call sequence are as described in the
appropriate section of the Chapter {\hyperref[nvectors/index:nvectors]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Vector Data Structures}}}}.


\subsubsection{Problem specification}
\label{f_interface/Usage:problem-specification}\label{f_interface/Usage:finterface-problem}
To set various problem and solution parameters and allocate internal
memory, the user must call {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC]{\emph{\code{FARKMALLOC()}}}}.
\index{FARKMALLOC() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKMALLOC}}{\emph{T0}, \emph{Y0}, \emph{IMEX}, \emph{IATOL}, \emph{RTOL}, \emph{ATOL}, \emph{IOUT}, \emph{ROUT}, \emph{IPAR}, \emph{RPAR}, \emph{IER}}{}
Initializes the Fortran interface to the ARKode solver, providing
interfaces to the C routines {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeCreate]{\emph{\code{ARKodeCreate()}}}},
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSetUserData]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSetUserData()}}}}, and {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeInit()}}}}, as well
as one of {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSStolerances]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSStolerances()}}}} or
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeSVtolerances]{\emph{\code{ARKodeSVtolerances()}}}}.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}

\item {} 
\emph{Y0} (\code{realtype}, input) -- array of initial conditions.

\item {} 
\emph{IMEX} (\code{int}, input) -- flag denoting basic integration
method: 0 = implicit, 1 = explicit, 2 = ImEx.

\item {} 
\emph{IATOL} (\code{int}, input) -- type for absolute tolerance input
\emph{ATOL}: 1 = scalar, 2 = array, 3 = user-supplied function; the
user must subsequently call {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKEWTSET]{\emph{\code{FARKEWTSET()}}}} and supply
a routine {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKEWT]{\emph{\code{FARKEWT()}}}} to compute the error weight vector.

\item {} 
\emph{RTOL} (\code{realtype}, input) -- scalar relative tolerance.

\item {} 
\emph{ATOL} (\code{realtype}, input) -- scalar or array absolute tolerance.

unmodified to all user-provided routines.

\item {} 
\emph{IER} (\code{int}, output) -- return flag (0 success, \(\ne 0\) failure).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Notes:} Modifications to the user data arrays \emph{IPAR} and \emph{RPAR}
inside a user-provided routine will be propagated to all
subsequent calls to such routines. The optional outputs
associated with the main ARKode integrator are listed in
{\hyperref[f_interface/Optional_output:finterface-iouttable]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Table: Optional FARKODE integer outputs}}}} and {\hyperref[f_interface/Optional_output:finterface-routtable]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Table: Optional FARKODE real outputs}}}}, in
the section {\hyperref[f_interface/Optional_output:finterface-optionaloutputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{FARKODE optional output}}}}.

\end{fulllineitems}


As an alternative to providing tolerances in the call to
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC]{\emph{\code{FARKMALLOC()}}}}, the user may provide a routine to compute the
error weights used in the WRMS norm evaluations.  If supplied, it must
have the following form:
\index{FARKEWT() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKEWT}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKEWT}}{\emph{Y}, \emph{EWT}, \emph{IPAR}, \emph{RPAR}, \emph{IER}}{}
It must set the positive components of the error weight
vector \emph{EWT} for the calculation of the WRMS norm of \emph{Y}.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{Y} (\code{realtype}, input) -- array containing state variables.

\item {} 
\emph{EWT} (\code{realtype}, output) -- array containing the error weight vector.

{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC]{\emph{\code{FARKMALLOC()}}}}.

\item {} 
\emph{IER} (\code{int}, output) -- return flag (0 success, \(\ne 0\) failure).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\end{fulllineitems}


If the {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKEWT]{\emph{\code{FARKEWT()}}}} routine is provided, then, following the
call to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC]{\emph{\code{FARKMALLOC()}}}}, the user must call the function
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKEWTSET]{\emph{\code{FARKEWTSET()}}}}.
\index{FARKEWTSET() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKEWTSET}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKEWTSET}}{\emph{FLAG}, \emph{IER}}{}
Informs FARKODE to use the user-supplied {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKEWT]{\emph{\code{FARKEWT()}}}} function.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{FLAG} (\code{int}, input) -- flag, use ``1'' to denoting to use {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKEWT]{\emph{\code{FARKEWT()}}}}.

\item {} 
\emph{IER} (\code{int}, output) -- return flag (0 success, \(\ne 0\) failure).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\end{fulllineitems}



\subsubsection{Setting optional inputs}
\label{f_interface/Usage:setting-optional-inputs}\label{f_interface/Usage:finterface-optionalinputs}
Unlike ARKode's C interface, that provides separate functions for
setting each optional input, FARKODE uses only two functions, that
accept keywords to specify which optional input should be set to the
provided value.  These routines are {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETIIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETIIN()}}}} and
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSETRIN]{\emph{\code{FARKSETRIN()}}}}, and are further described below.

\subsubsection{System linear solver specification}
\label{f_interface/Usage:system-linear-solver-specification}\label{f_interface/Usage:finterface-linearsolver}
In the case of using either an implicit or ImEx method, the solution
of each Runge-Kutta stage may involve the solution of linear systems
related to the Jacobian \(J = \frac{\partial f_I}{\partial y}\) of
the implicit portion of the ODE system. ARKode presently includes
a variety of choices for the treatment of these systems, and the user
of FARKODE must call a routine with a specific name to make the
desired choice.  We note that the direct (dense or band) and sparse
linear solver options are only usable in a serial environment.


\paragraph{Dense treatment of the linear system}
\label{f_interface/Usage:dense-treatment-of-the-linear-system}
To use the direct dense linear solver based on the internal SUNDIALS
implementation, the user must call the {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKDENSE]{\emph{\code{FARKDENSE()}}}} routine:
\index{FARKDENSE() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKDENSE}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKDENSE}}{\emph{NEQ}, \emph{IER}}{}

\emph{IER} (\code{int}, output) -- return flag (0 if success, -1 if a memory allocation
error occurred, -2 for an illegal input).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\end{fulllineitems}


Alteratively, to use the LAPACK-based direct dense linear solver, a
user must call the similar {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKLAPACKDENSE]{\emph{\code{FARKLAPACKDENSE()}}}} routine:
\index{FARKLAPACKDENSE() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\end{fulllineitems}


As an option when using either of these dense linear solvers, the user
may supply a routine that computes a dense approximation of the system
Jacobian \(J = \frac{\partial f_I}{\partial y}\).  If supplied, it
must have the following form:
\index{FARKDJAC() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKDJAC}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKDJAC}}{\emph{NEQ}, \emph{T}, \emph{Y}, \emph{FY}, \emph{DJAC}, \emph{H}, \emph{IPAR}, \emph{RPAR}, \emph{WK1}, \emph{WK2}, \emph{WK3}, \emph{IER}}{}
Interface to provide a user-supplied dense Jacobian approximation
function (of type {\hyperref[c_interface/User_supplied:c.ARKDlsDenseJacFn]{\emph{\code{ARKDlsDenseJacFn()}}}}), to be used by the
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKDENSE]{\emph{\code{FARKDENSE()}}}} solver.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}

\emph{IER} (\code{int}, output) -- return flag (0 if success, \textgreater{}0 if a recoverable error
occurred, \textless{}0 if an unrecoverable error occurred).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Notes:} Typically this routine will use only \emph{NEQ}, \emph{T}, \emph{Y}, and
\emph{DJAC}. It must compute the Jacobian and store it column-wise in \emph{DJAC}.

\end{fulllineitems}


If the above routine uses difference quotient approximations, it may
need to access the error weight array \emph{EWT} in the calculation of
suitable increments. The array \emph{EWT} can be obtained by calling
{\hyperref[f_interface/Optional_output:f/_/FARKGETERRWEIGHTS]{\emph{\code{FARKGETERRWEIGHTS()}}}} using one of the work arrays as
temporary storage for \emph{EWT}. It may also need the unit roundoff, which
can be obtained as the optional output \emph{ROUT(6)}, passed from the
calling program to this routine using either \emph{RPAR} or a common block.

If the {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKDJAC]{\emph{\code{FARKDJAC()}}}} routine is provided, then, following the
call to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKDENSE]{\emph{\code{FARKDENSE()}}}} or {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKLAPACKDENSE]{\emph{\code{FARKLAPACKDENSE()}}}}, the user

If the above routine uses difference quotient approximations, it may
need to use the error weight array \emph{EWT} in the calculation of
suitable increments. The array \emph{EWT} can be obtained by calling

arrays as temporary storage for \emph{EWT}. It may also need the unit
roundoff, which can be obtained as the optional output \emph{ROUT(6)},
passed from the calling program to this routine using either \emph{RPAR}
or a common block.

If the {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKBJAC]{\emph{\code{FARKBJAC()}}}} routine is provided, then, following the

\subsubsection{Mass matrix linear solver specification}
\label{f_interface/Usage:finterface-masslinearsolver}\label{f_interface/Usage:mass-matrix-linear-solver-specification}
As described in the section {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-masssolve]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Mass matrix solver}}}}, in the case
of using a problem with a non-identity mass matrix (no matter whether
the integrator is implicit, explicit or ImEx), linear systems of the
form \(Mx=b\) must be solved, where \(M(t)\) is the possibly
time-dependent system mass matrix.  ARKode presently includes
a variety of choices for the treatment of these systems, and the user
of FARKODE must call a routine with a specific name to make the
desired choice.  We again note that the direct (dense or band) and sparse
linear solver options are only usable in a serial environment.

Re-initializes the Fortran interface to the ARKode solver.

\textbf{Arguments:}  The arguments have the same names and meanings as those of
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC]{\emph{\code{FARKMALLOC()}}}}.

\textbf{Notes:}
This routine performs no memory allocation, instead using the
existing memory created by the previous {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC]{\emph{\code{FARKMALLOC()}}}}
call.  The call to specify the linear system solution method may
or may not be needed.

\end{fulllineitems}


Following a call to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKREINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKREINIT()}}}}, a call to specify the
linear system solver must be made if the choice of linear solver is
being changed.  Otherwise, a call to reinitialize the linear solver
last used is only needed if linear solver input parameters need
modification.

In the case of the BAND solver, for any change in the
half-bandwidth parameters, call {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKBAND]{\emph{\code{FARKBAND()}}}} (or
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKLAPACKBAND]{\emph{\code{FARKLAPACKBAND()}}}}) again, as described above.

In the case of the KLU sparse solver, ARKode will reuse much of the
factorization information from nonlinear iteration, stage and time
step to the next.  If at any time the user wants to force a full
refactorization, or if the number of nonzeros in the Jacobian matrix
changes, the user should call {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKKLUREINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKKLUREINIT()}}}}, as follows:
\index{FARKKLUREINIT() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKKLUREINIT}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKKLUREINIT}}{\emph{NEQ}, \emph{NNZ}, \emph{REINIT\_TYPE}}{}
Re-initializes the factorization of the KLU sparse Jacobian.
\begin{description}

We note that similar functionality is not provided for the ARKode
interface to the SuperLU\_MT sparse solver.

In the case of SPGMR, for a change of inputs other than \emph{MAXL},
the user may call the routine {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPGMRREINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKSPGMRREINIT()}}}} to

\end{fulllineitems}


However, if \emph{MAXL} is being changed, then the user should call
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPGMR]{\emph{\code{FARKSPGMR()}}}} instead, since memory will need to be

Re-initializes the Fortran interface to the SPFGMR
linear solver.

\textbf{Arguments:}  The arguments have the same names and meanings as
those of {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPFGMR]{\emph{\code{FARKSPFGMR()}}}}.

In the case of PCG, for a change in any inputs, the user can

\end{fulllineitems}


Similarly, following a call to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKREINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKREINIT()}}}}, a call to
specify the mass matrix linear system solver must be made if the
choice of mass matrix linear solver is being changed.  Otherwise, a
call to reinitialize the mass matrix linear solver last used is only
needed if linear solver input parameters need modification.

In the case of the BAND solver, for any change in the
half-bandwidth parameters, call {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMASSBAND]{\emph{\code{FARKMASSBAND()}}}} (or
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMASSLAPACKBAND]{\emph{\code{FARKMASSLAPACKBAND()}}}}) again, as described above.

In the case of the KLU sparse solver, ARKode will reuse much of the
factorization information from one solve to the next.  It is therefore
recommended that on problem re-initialization the user force a full
refactorization of the system mass matrix with a call to
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMASSKLUREINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKMASSKLUREINIT()}}}}, as follows:

\subsubsection{Resizing the ODE system}
\label{f_interface/Usage:finterface-resize}\label{f_interface/Usage:resizing-the-ode-system}
For simulations involving changes to the number of equations and
unknowns in the ODE system (e.g. when solving a spatially-adaptive
PDE), the {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKODE]{\emph{\code{FARKODE()}}}} integrator may be ``resized'' between
integration steps, through calls to the {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKRESIZE]{\emph{\code{FARKRESIZE()}}}}
function, that interfaces with the C routine {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeResize]{\emph{\code{ARKodeResize()}}}}.
This function modifies ARKode's internal memory structures to use the
new problem size, without destruction of the temporal adaptivity
heuristics.  It is assumed that the dynamical time scales before and
after the vector resize will be comparable, so that all time-stepping
heuristics prior to calling \code{FARKRESIZE()} remain valid after
the call.  If instead the dynamics should be re-calibrated, the
FARKODE memory structure should be deleted with a call to
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKFREE]{\emph{\code{FARKFREE()}}}}, and re-created with a call to
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC]{\emph{\code{FARKMALLOC()}}}}.
\index{FARKRESIZE() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKRESIZE}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKRESIZE}}{\emph{T0}, \emph{Y0}, \emph{HSCALE}, \emph{ITOL}, \emph{RTOL}, \emph{ATOL}, \emph{IER}}{}
Re-initializes the Fortran interface to the ARKode solver for a
differently-sized ODE system.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{T0} (\code{realtype}, input) -- initial value of the independent
variable \(t\).

\item {} 
\emph{Y0} (\code{realtype}, input) -- array of dependent-variable
initial conditions.

\item {} 
\emph{HSCALE} (\code{realtype}, input) -- desired step size scale factor:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
1.0 is the default,

\item {} 
any value \textless{}= 0.0 results in the default.

\end{itemize}

\item {} 
\emph{ITOL} (\code{int}, input) -- flag denoting that a new relative
tolerance and vector of absolute tolerances are supplied in
the \emph{RTOL} and \emph{ATOL} arguments:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
0 = retain the current scalar-valued relative and absolute
tolerances, or the user-supplied error weight function,
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKEWT]{\emph{\code{FARKEWT()}}}}.

\item {} 
1 = \emph{RTOL} contains the new scalar-valued relative tolerance
and \emph{ATOL} contains a new array of absolute tolerances.

\end{itemize}

\item {} 
\emph{RTOL} (\code{realtype}, input) -- scalar relative tolerance.

\item {} 
\emph{ATOL} (\code{realtype}, input) -- array of absolute tolerances.

\item {} 
\emph{IER} (\code{int}, output) -- return flag (0 success, \(\ne 0\) failure).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Notes:}
This routine performs the opposite set of of operations as
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKREINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKREINIT()}}}}: it does not reinitialize any of the
time-step heuristics, but it does perform memory reallocation.

\end{fulllineitems}


Following a call to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKRESIZE]{\emph{\code{FARKRESIZE()}}}}, a call to re-specify the
linear system solver must be made \textbf{after} the call to
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKRESIZE]{\emph{\code{FARKRESIZE()}}}}, since the internal data structures for all
linear solvers will also be the incorrect size.

If any user-supplied linear solver helper routines were used (Jacobian
evaluation, Jacobian-vector product, mass matrix evaluation,
mass-matrix-vector product, preconditioning, etc.), then the
relevant ``set'' routines to specify their usage must be called again
\textbf{following} the re-specification of the linear solver module(s).


\subsubsection{Memory deallocation}
\label{f_interface/Usage:finterface-deallocation}\label{f_interface/Usage:memory-deallocation}
To free the internal memory created by {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC]{\emph{\code{FARKMALLOC()}}}}, the user
may call {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKFREE]{\emph{\code{FARKFREE()}}}}, as follows:
\index{FARKFREE() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKFREE}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKFREE}}{}{}
Frees the internal memory created by {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC]{\emph{\code{FARKMALLOC()}}}}.

\textbf{Arguments:} None.

\subsection{FARKODE optional output}
\label{f_interface/Optional_output:finterface-optionaloutputs}\label{f_interface/Optional_output:farkode-optional-output}\label{f_interface/Optional_output::doc}
We note that the optional inputs to FARKODE have already been
described in the section {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:finterface-optionalinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Setting optional inputs}}}}.


\subsubsection{IOUT and ROUT arrays}
\label{f_interface/Optional_output:iout-and-rout-arrays}
In the Fortran interface, the optional outputs from the
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKODE]{\emph{\code{FARKODE()}}}} solver are accessed not through individual
functions, but rather through a pair of user-allocated arrays, \emph{IOUT}
(having \code{long int} type) of dimension at least 29, and \emph{ROUT}
(having \code{realtype} type) of dimension at least 6.  These arrays must
be allocated by the user program that calls {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKODE]{\emph{\code{FARKODE()}}}}, that
passes them through the Fortran interface as arguments to
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC]{\emph{\code{FARKMALLOC()}}}}.  Following this call, {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKODE]{\emph{\code{FARKODE()}}}} will
modify the entries of these arrays to contain all optional output
values provided to a Fortran user.

In the following tables, {\hyperref[f_interface/Optional_output:finterface-iouttable]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Table: Optional FARKODE integer outputs}}}} and
{\hyperref[f_interface/Optional_output:finterface-routtable]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Table: Optional FARKODE real outputs}}}}, we list the entries in these
arrays by index, naming them according to their role with the main
ARKode solver, and list the relevant ARKode C/C++ function that is
actually called to extract the output value.  Similarly, optional
integer output values that are specific to the ARKDENSE and ARKBAND
linear solvers are listed in {\hyperref[f_interface/Optional_output:finterface-dlsiouttable]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Table: Optional ARKDENSE and ARKBAND outputs}}}}, optional
integer output values that are specific to the ARKKLU and ARKSUPERLUMT
linear solvers are listed in {\hyperref[f_interface/Optional_output:finterface-slsiouttable]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Table: Optional ARKKLU and ARKSUPERLUMT outputs}}}}, while
integer optional output values specific to the ARKSPGMR,
ARKSPBCG, ARKSPTFQMR, ARKSPFGMR and ARKPCG iterative linear solvers
are listed in {\hyperref[f_interface/Optional_output:finterface-spilsiouttable]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Table: Optional ARKSPGMR, ARKSPBCG, ARKSPTFQMR, ARKSPFGMR and ARKPCG outputs}}}}.

For more details on the optional inputs and outputs to ARKode, see
the sections {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionalinputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional input functions}}}} and
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-optionaloutputs]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Optional output functions}}}}.

\subsubsection{Additional optional output routines}
\label{f_interface/Optional_output:additional-optional-output-routines}
In addition to the optional inputs communicated through FARKSET*
calls and the optional outputs extracted from \emph{IOUT} and \emph{ROUT},
the following user-callable routines are available.

To obtain the error weight array \emph{EWT}, containing the
multiplicative error weights used in the WRMS norms, the user may call
the routine {\hyperref[f_interface/Optional_output:f/_/FARKGETERRWEIGHTS]{\emph{\code{FARKGETERRWEIGHTS()}}}} as follows:
\index{FARKGETERRWEIGHTS() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Optional_output:f/_/FARKGETERRWEIGHTS}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKGETERRWEIGHTS}}{\emph{EWT}, \emph{IER}}{}
Retrieves the current error weight vector (interfaces
with {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeGetErrWeights]{\emph{\code{ARKodeGetErrWeights()}}}}).
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{EWT} (\code{realtype}, output) -- array containing the error
weight vector.

\item {} 
\emph{IER}  (\code{int}, output) -- return flag  (0 if success,
\(\ne 0\) if an error).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Notes:}
The array \emph{EWT} must have already been allocated by the user, of
the same size as the solution array \emph{Y}.

\end{fulllineitems}


Similarly, to obtain the estimated local truncation errors, following
a successful call to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKODE]{\emph{\code{FARKODE()}}}}, the user may call the
routine {\hyperref[f_interface/Optional_output:f/_/FARKGETESTLOCALERR]{\emph{\code{FARKGETESTLOCALERR()}}}} as follows:
\index{FARKGETESTLOCALERR() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Optional_output:f/_/FARKGETESTLOCALERR}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKGETESTLOCALERR}}{\emph{ELE}, \emph{IER}}{}
Retrieves the current local truncation error estimate
vector (interfaces with {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeGetEstLocalErrors]{\emph{\code{ARKodeGetEstLocalErrors()}}}}).
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{ELE} (\code{realtype}, output) -- array with the estimated local
truncation error vector.

\item {} 
\emph{IER}  (\code{int}, output) -- return flag  (0 if success,
\(\ne 0\) if an error).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Notes:}
The array \emph{ELE} must have already been allocated by the user, of

\subsection{Usage of the FARKROOT interface to rootfinding}
\label{f_interface/Rootfinding:usage-of-the-farkroot-interface-to-rootfinding}\label{f_interface/Rootfinding::doc}\label{f_interface/Rootfinding:finterface-rootfinding}
The FARKROOT interface package allows programs written in Fortran to
use the rootfinding feature of the ARKode solver module. The
user-callable functions in FARKROOT, with the corresponding ARKODE
functions, are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
{\hyperref[f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKROOTINIT()}}}} interfaces to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeRootInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeRootInit()}}}},

\item {} 
{\hyperref[f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTINFO]{\emph{\code{FARKROOTINFO()}}}} interfaces to
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeGetRootInfo]{\emph{\code{ARKodeGetRootInfo()}}}}, and

\item {} 
{\hyperref[f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTFREE]{\emph{\code{FARKROOTFREE()}}}} interfaces to {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:c.ARKodeRootInit]{\emph{\code{ARKodeRootInit()}}}},
freeing memory by calling the initializer with no root functions.

\end{itemize}

Note that at this time, FARKROOT does not provide support to specify
the direction of zero-crossing that is to be monitored.  Instead, all
roots are considered.  However, the actual direction of zero-crossing
may be captured by the user through monitoring the sign of any
non-zero elements in the array \emph{INFO} returned by
{\hyperref[f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTINFO]{\emph{\code{FARKROOTINFO()}}}}.

In order to use the rootfinding feature of ARKode, after calling {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC]{\emph{\code{FARKMALLOC()}}}} but prior to
calling {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKODE]{\emph{\code{FARKODE()}}}}, the user must call
{\hyperref[f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKROOTINIT()}}}} to allocate and initialize memory for the FARKROOT module:
\index{FARKROOTINIT() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTINIT}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKROOTINIT}}{\emph{NRTFN}, \emph{IER}}{}
Initializes the Fortran interface to the FARKROOT module.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{NRTFN} (\code{int}, input) -- total number of root functions.

\item {} 
\emph{IER} (\code{int}, output) -- return flag (0 success, -1 if
ARKode memory is \code{NULL}, and -11 if a memory allocation
error occurred).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\end{fulllineitems}


If rootfinding is enabled, the user must specify the functions whose
roots are to be found.  These rootfinding functions should be
implemented in the user-supplied {\hyperref[f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTFN]{\emph{\code{FARKROOTFN()}}}} subroutine:
\index{FARKROOTFN() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTFN}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKROOTFN}}{\emph{T}, \emph{Y}, \emph{G}, \emph{IPAR}, \emph{RPAR}, \emph{IER}}{}
User supplied function implementing the vector-valued function
\(g(t,y)\) such that the roots of the \emph{NRTFN} components
\(g_i(t,y)=0\) are sought.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{T} (\code{realtype}, input) -- independent variable value \(t\).

\item {} 
\emph{Y} (\code{realtype}, input) -- dependent variable array \(y\).

\item {} 
\emph{G} (\code{realtype}, output) -- function value array \(g(t,y)\).

\item {} 
\emph{IPAR} (\code{long int}, input/output) -- integer user data
array, the same as the array passed to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC]{\emph{\code{FARKMALLOC()}}}}.

\item {} 
\emph{RPAR} (\code{realtype}, input/output) -- real-valued user data
array, the same as the array passed to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKMALLOC]{\emph{\code{FARKMALLOC()}}}}.

\item {} 
\emph{IER}  (\code{int}, output) -- return flag (0 success, \(<0\)
if error).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\end{fulllineitems}


When making calls to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKODE]{\emph{\code{FARKODE()}}}} to solve the ODE system, the
occurrence of a root is flagged by the return value \emph{IER = 2}.  In
that case, if \emph{NRTFN \textgreater{} 1}, the functions \(g_i(t,y)\) which were
found to have a root can be identified by calling the routine
{\hyperref[f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTINFO]{\emph{\code{FARKROOTINFO()}}}}:
\index{FARKROOTINFO() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTINFO}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKROOTINFO}}{\emph{NRTFN}, \emph{INFO}, \emph{IER}}{}
Initializes the Fortran interface to the FARKROOT module.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{NRTFN} (\code{int}, input) -- total number of root functions.

\item {} 
\emph{INFO} (\code{int}, input/output) -- array of length \emph{NRTFN} with
root information (must be allocated by the user).  For each
index, \emph{i = 1, ..., NRTFN}:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{INFO(i) = 1}  if \(g_i(t,y)\) was found to have a root,
and \(g_i\) is increasing.

\item {} 
\emph{INFO(i) = -1}  if \(g_i(t,y)\) was found to have a root,
and \(g_i\) is decreasing.

\item {} 
\emph{INFO(i) = 0}  otherwise.

\end{itemize}

\item {} 
\emph{IER} (\code{int}, output) -- return flag (0 success, \(<0\)
if error).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\end{fulllineitems}


The total number of calls made to the root function
{\hyperref[f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTFN]{\emph{\code{FARKROOTFN()}}}}, denoted \emph{NGE}, can be obtained from
\emph{IOUT(12)}.  If the FARKODE/ARKode memory block is reinitialized to
solve a different problem via a call to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKREINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKREINIT()}}}}, then
the counter \emph{NGE} is reset to zero.

Lastly, to free the memory resources allocated by a prior call to
{\hyperref[f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKROOTINIT()}}}}, the user must make a call to
{\hyperref[f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTFREE]{\emph{\code{FARKROOTFREE()}}}}:
\index{FARKROOTFREE() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Rootfinding:f/_/FARKROOTFREE}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKROOTFREE}}{}{}
Frees memory associated with the FARKODE rootfinding module.

\end{fulllineitems}



\subsection{Usage of the FARKODE interface to built-in preconditioners}
\label{f_interface/Preconditioning:finterface-preconditioning}\label{f_interface/Preconditioning::doc}\label{f_interface/Preconditioning:usage-of-the-farkode-interface-to-built-in-preconditioners}
The FARKODE interface enables usage of the two built-in
preconditioning modules ARKBANDPRE and ARKBBDPRE.  Details on how
these preconditioners work are provided in the section
{\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:cinterface-preconditionermodules]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Preconditioner modules}}}}.  In this section, we focus
specifically on the Fortran interface to these modules.


\subsubsection{Usage of the FARKBP interface to ARKBANDPRE}
\label{f_interface/Preconditioning:usage-of-the-farkbp-interface-to-arkbandpre}\label{f_interface/Preconditioning:finterface-bandpre}
The FARKBP interface module is a package of C functions which,
as part of the FARKODE interface module, support the use of the
ARKode solver with the serial or threaded NVector modules
({\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Serial:nvectors-nvserial]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_SERIAL Module}}}}, {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_OpenMP:nvectors-openmp]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_OPENMP Module}}}} or
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Pthreads:nvectors-pthreads]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_PTHREADS Module}}}}), and the combination of the ARKBANDPRE
preconditioner module (see the section {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:cinterface-bandpre]{\emph{\DUspan{}{A serial banded preconditioner module}}}}) with
any of the Krylov iterative linear solvers.

The two user-callable functions in this package, with the
corresponding ARKode function around which they wrap, are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
{\hyperref[f_interface/Preconditioning:f/_/FARKBPINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKBPINIT()}}}} interfaces to {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKBandPrecInit]{\emph{\code{ARKBandPrecInit()}}}}.

\item {} 
{\hyperref[f_interface/Preconditioning:f/_/FARKBPOPT]{\emph{\code{FARKBPOPT()}}}} interfaces to the ARKBANDPRE optional output
functions, {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKBandPrecGetWorkSpace]{\emph{\code{ARKBandPrecGetWorkSpace()}}}} and
{\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:c.ARKBandPrecGetNumRhsEvals]{\emph{\code{ARKBandPrecGetNumRhsEvals()}}}}.

\end{itemize}

As with the rest of the FARKODE routines, the names of the
user-supplied routines are mapped to actual values through a series of
definitions in the header file \code{farkbp.h}.

The following is a summary of the usage of this module.  Steps that
are unchanged from the main program described in the section
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:finterface-usage]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Usage of the FARKODE interface module}}}} are \emph{italicized}.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
\emph{Right-hand side specification}

\item {} 
\emph{NVECTOR module initialization}

\item {} 
\emph{Problem specification}

\item {} 
\emph{Set optional inputs}

\item {} 
Linear solver specification

First, specify one of the ARKSPILS iterative linear solvers, by
calling one of {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPGMR]{\emph{\code{FARKSPGMR()}}}}, {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPBCG]{\emph{\code{FARKSPBCG()}}}},
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPTFQMR]{\emph{\code{FARKSPTFQMR()}}}}, {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPFGMR]{\emph{\code{FARKSPFGMR()}}}} or
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKPCG]{\emph{\code{FARKPCG()}}}}.

Optionally, to specify that SPGMR, SPBCG, SPTFQMR, SPFGMR or PCG
should use the supplied {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKJTIMES]{\emph{\code{FARKJTIMES()}}}} routine, the user
should call {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPILSSETJAC]{\emph{\code{FARKSPILSSETJAC()}}}} with FLAG \(\ne 0\),
as described in the section {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:finterface-spilsusersupplied]{\emph{\DUspan{}{User-supplied routines for SPGMR/SPBCG/SPTFQMR/SPFGMR/PCG}}}}.

Then, to initialize the ARKBANDPRE preconditioner, call the
routine {\hyperref[f_interface/Preconditioning:f/_/FARKBPINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKBPINIT()}}}}, as follows:
\index{FARKBPINIT() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{f_interface/Preconditioning:f/_/FARKBPINIT}\pysiglinewithargsret{\strong{subroutine  }\bfcode{FARKBPINIT}}{\emph{NEQ}, \emph{MU}, \emph{ML}, \emph{IER}}{}

band matrix approximation to the Jacobian.

\item {} 
\emph{IER}  (\code{int}, output) -- return flag  (0 if success, -1
if a memory failure).

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\end{fulllineitems}


\item {} 
\emph{Problem solution}

\item {} 
ARKBANDPRE optional outputs

Optional outputs specific to the SPGMR, SPBCG, SPTFQMR, SPFGMR or
PCG solver are listed in {\hyperref[f_interface/Optional_output:finterface-spilsiouttable]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Table: Optional ARKSPGMR, ARKSPBCG, ARKSPTFQMR, ARKSPFGMR and ARKPCG outputs}}}}.  To
obtain the optional outputs associated with the ARKBANDPRE module,
the user should call the {\hyperref[f_interface/Preconditioning:f/_/FARKBPOPT]{\emph{\code{FARKBPOPT()}}}}, as specified below:
\index{FARKBPOPT() (fortran subroutine)|textbf}

\begin{fulllineitems}

\subsubsection{Usage of the FARKBBD interface to ARKBBDPRE}
\label{f_interface/Preconditioning:usage-of-the-farkbbd-interface-to-arkbbdpre}\label{f_interface/Preconditioning:finterface-bbdpre}
The FARKBBD interface module is a package of C functions which, as
part of the FARKODE interface module, support the use of the ARKode
solver with the parallel vector module ({\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Parallel:nvectors-nvparallel]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_PARALLEL Module}}}}),
and the combination of the ARKBBDPRE preconditioner module (see the
section {\hyperref[c_interface/Preconditioners:cinterface-bbdpre]{\emph{\DUspan{}{A parallel band-block-diagonal preconditioner module}}}}) with any of the Krylov iterative
linear solvers.

The user-callable functions in this package, with the corresponding
ARKode and ARKBBDPRE functions, are as follows:

As with the rest of the FARKODE routines, the names of all
user-supplied routines here are fixed, in order to maximize
portability for the resulting mixed-language program.  Additionally,
based on flags discussed above in the section {\hyperref[f_interface/Routines:finterface-routines]{\emph{\DUspan{}{FARKODE routines}}}},
the names of the user-supplied routines are mapped to actual values
through a series of definitions in the header file \code{farkbbd.h}.

The following is a summary of the usage of this module. Steps that are
unchanged from the main program described in the section
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:finterface-usage]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Usage of the FARKODE interface module}}}} are \emph{italicized}.

Linear solver specification

First, specify one of the ARKSPILS iterative linear solvers, by
calling one of {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPGMR]{\emph{\code{FARKSPGMR()}}}}, {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPBCG]{\emph{\code{FARKSPBCG()}}}},

{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKPCG]{\emph{\code{FARKPCG()}}}}.

Optionally, to specify that SPGMR, SPBCG, SPTFQMR, SPFGMR or PCG
should use the supplied {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKJTIMES]{\emph{\code{FARKJTIMES()}}}} routine, the user
should call {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPILSSETJAC]{\emph{\code{FARKSPILSSETJAC()}}}} with FLAG \(\ne 0\),
as described in the section {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:finterface-spilsusersupplied]{\emph{\DUspan{}{User-supplied routines for SPGMR/SPBCG/SPTFQMR/SPFGMR/PCG}}}}.

Then, to initialize the ARKBBDPRE preconditioner, call the function

Problem reinitialization

If a sequence of problems of the same size is being solved using
the same linear solver (SPGMR, SPBCG, SPTFQMR, SPFGMR or PCG) in
combination with the ARKBBDPRE preconditioner, then the ARKode
package can be re-initialized for the second and subsequent
problems by calling {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKREINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKREINIT()}}}}, following which a call
to {\hyperref[f_interface/Preconditioning:f/_/FARKBBDREINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKBBDREINIT()}}}} may or may not be needed. If the input
arguments are the same, no {\hyperref[f_interface/Preconditioning:f/_/FARKBBDREINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKBBDREINIT()}}}} call is
needed.

If there is a change in input arguments other than \emph{MU} or
\emph{ML}, then the user program should call {\hyperref[f_interface/Preconditioning:f/_/FARKBBDREINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKBBDREINIT()}}}}
as specified below:

However, if the value of \emph{MU} or \emph{ML} is being changed, then a call
to {\hyperref[f_interface/Preconditioning:f/_/FARKBBDINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKBBDINIT()}}}} must be made instead.

Finally, if there is a change in any of the linear solver inputs,
then a call to {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPGMR]{\emph{\code{FARKSPGMR()}}}}, {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPBCG]{\emph{\code{FARKSPBCG()}}}},
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPTFQMR]{\emph{\code{FARKSPTFQMR()}}}}, {\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKSPFGMR]{\emph{\code{FARKSPFGMR()}}}} or

dyanamical time scales) is being solved using the same linear
solver (SPGMR, SPBCG, SPTFQMR, SPFGMR or PCG) in combination with
the ARKBBDPRE preconditioner, then the ARKode package can be
re-initialized for the second and subsequent problems by calling
{\hyperref[f_interface/Usage:f/_/FARKRESIZE]{\emph{\code{FARKRESIZE()}}}}, following which a call to
{\hyperref[f_interface/Preconditioning:f/_/FARKBBDINIT]{\emph{\code{FARKBBDINIT()}}}} is required to delete and re-allocate the
preconditioner memory of the correct size.

\chapter{Vector Data Structures}
\label{nvectors/index:nvectors}\label{nvectors/index::doc}\label{nvectors/index:vector-data-structures}
The SUNDIALS library comes packaged with a variety of NVECTOR
implementations, designed for simulations in serial, shared-memory
parallel, and distributed-memory parallel environments, as well as
interfaces to vector data structures used within external linear
solver libraries.  All native implementations assume that the
process-local data is stored contiguously, and they in turn provide a
variety of standard vector algebra operations that may be performed on
the data.

In addition, SUNDIALS provides a simple interface for generic vectors
(akin to a C++ \emph{abstract base class}).  All of the major SUNDIALS
solvers (CVODE(s), IDA(s), KINSOL, ARKODE) in turn are constructed to
only depend on these generic vector operations, making them immediately
extensible to new user-defined vector objects.  The only exceptions to
this rule relate to the dense, banded and sparse-direct linear system
solvers, since they rely on particular data storage and access
patterns in the NVECTORS used.


\section{Description of the NVECTOR Modules}
\label{nvectors/NVector_Description:description-of-the-nvector-modules}\label{nvectors/NVector_Description:nvectors-description}\label{nvectors/NVector_Description::doc}
The SUNDIALS solvers are written in a data-independent manner. They
all operate on generic vectors (of type \code{N\_Vector}) through a set of
operations defined by, and specific to, the particular NVECTOR
implementation. Users can provide a custom implementation of the
NVECTOR module or use one of four provided within SUNDIALS -- a serial
and three parallel implementations.  The generic operations are
described below.  In the sections following, the implementations
provided with SUNDIALS are described.

The generic \code{N\_Vector} type is a pointer to a structure that has an
implementation-dependent \emph{content} field containing the description
and actual data of the vector, and an \emph{ops} field pointing to a
structure with generic vector operations. The type \code{N\_Vector} is
defined as:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{k}{typedef} \PYG{k}{struct} \PYG{n}{\PYGZus{}generic\PYGZus{}N\PYGZus{}Vector} \PYG{o}{*}\PYG{n}{N\PYGZus{}Vector}\PYG{p}{;}

\PYG{k}{struct} \PYG{n}{\PYGZus{}generic\PYGZus{}N\PYGZus{}Vector} \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
   \PYG{k+kt}{void} \PYG{o}{*}\PYG{n}{content}\PYG{p}{;}
   \PYG{k}{struct} \PYG{n}{\PYGZus{}generic\PYGZus{}N\PYGZus{}Vector\PYGZus{}Ops} \PYG{o}{*}\PYG{n}{ops}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

Here, the \code{\_generic\_N\_Vector\_Op} structure is essentially a list of
function pointers to the various actual vector operations, and is
defined as

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{k}{struct} \PYG{n}{\PYGZus{}generic\PYGZus{}N\PYGZus{}Vector\PYGZus{}Ops} \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}

The generic NVECTOR module defines and implements the vector
operations acting on a \code{N\_Vector}. These routines are nothing but
wrappers for the vector operations defined by a particular NVECTOR
implementation, which are accessed through the \emph{ops} field of the
\code{N\_Vector} structure. To illustrate this point we show below the
implementation of a typical vector operation from the generic NVECTOR
module, namely \code{N\_VScale}, which performs the scaling of a vector
\code{x} by a scalar \code{c}:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{k+kt}{void} \PYG{n+nf}{N\PYGZus{}VScale}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{realtype} \PYG{n}{c}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{N\PYGZus{}Vector} \PYG{n}{x}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{N\PYGZus{}Vector} \PYG{n}{z}\PYG{p}{)} \PYG{p}{\PYGZob{}}
   \PYG{n}{z}\PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{o}{\PYGZgt{}}\PYG{n}{ops}\PYG{o}{\PYGZhy{}}\PYG{o}{\PYGZgt{}}\PYG{n}{nvscale}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{c}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{x}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{z}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{p}{\PYGZcb{}}
\end{Verbatim}

The subsection {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Operations:nvectors-ops]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Description of the NVECTOR operations}}}} contains a complete list of all
vector operations defined by the generic NVECTOR module.  Finally, we
note that the generic NVECTOR module defines the functions
\code{N\_VCloneVectorArray} and \code{N\_VCloneVectorArrayEmpty}. Both
functions create (by cloning) an array of \emph{count} variables of type
\code{N\_Vector}, each of the same type as an existing \code{N\_Vector}. Their
prototypes are:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{n}{N\PYGZus{}Vector} \PYG{o}{*}\PYG{n+nf}{N\PYGZus{}VCloneVectorArray}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{k+kt}{int} \PYG{n}{count}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{N\PYGZus{}Vector} \PYG{n}{w}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\PYG{n}{N\PYGZus{}Vector} \PYG{o}{*}\PYG{n+nf}{N\PYGZus{}VCloneVectorArrayEmpty}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{k+kt}{int} \PYG{n}{count}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{n}{N\PYGZus{}Vector} \PYG{n}{w}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

and their definitions are based on the implementation-specific
\code{N\_VClone} and \code{N\_VCloneEmpty} operations, respectively.

Similarly, an array of variables of type \code{N\_Vector} can be destroyed
by calling \code{N\_VDestroyVectorArray}, whose prototype is

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{k+kt}{void} \PYG{n+nf}{N\PYGZus{}VDestroyVectorArray}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{N\PYGZus{}Vector} \PYG{o}{*}\PYG{n}{vs}\PYG{p}{,} \PYG{k+kt}{int} \PYG{n}{count}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}
\end{Verbatim}

and whose definition is based on the implementation-specific
\code{N\_VDestroy} operation.

In particular, any implementation of the NVECTOR module \textbf{must}:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Specify the \emph{content} field of the \code{N\_Vector}.

\item {} 
Define and implement the necessary vector operations. Note that the
names of these routines should be unique to that implementation in
order to permit using more than one NVECTOR module (each with
different \code{N\_Vector} internal data representations) in the same
code.  We further note that not all of the defined operations are
required for each solver in SUNDIALS.  The list of required
operations for use with ARKode is given in the section
{\hyperref[nvectors/ARKode_requirements:nvectors-arkode]{\emph{\DUspan{}{NVECTOR functions required by ARKode}}}}.

\item {} 
Define and implement user-callable constructor and destructor
routines to create and free a \code{N\_Vector} with the new \emph{content}
field and with \emph{ops} pointing to the new vector operations.

\item {} 
Optionally, define and implement additional user-callable routines
acting on the newly defined \code{N\_Vector} (e.g., a routine to print the
\emph{content} for debugging purposes).

\item {} 
Optionally, provide accessor macros as needed for that particular
implementation to be used to access different parts in the content
field of the newly defined \code{N\_Vector}.

\end{itemize}

Each NVECTOR implementation included in SUNDIALS has a unique
identifier specified in enumeration and shown in the table below.
It is recommended that a user supplied NVECTOR implementation use the
\code{SUNDIALS\_NVEC\_CUSTOM} identifier.

For each of the \code{N\_Vector} operations, we give the name, usage
of the function, and a description of its mathematical operations
below.

Returns the vector type identifier for the vector \code{w}.  It is
used to determine the vector implementation type (e.g. serial,
parallel, ...) from the abstract \code{N\_Vector} interface.  Returned
values are given in the table, {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Description:nvector-vectorids]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Vector Identifications associated with vector kernels supplied with SUNDIALS}}}}

Creates a new \code{N\_Vector} of the same type as an existing vector
\emph{w} and sets the \emph{ops} field.  It does not copy the vector, but
rather allocates storage for the new vector.

Usage:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{n}{v} \PYG{o}{=} \PYG{n}{N\PYGZus{}VClone}\PYG{p}{(}\PYG{n}{w}\PYG{p}{)}\PYG{p}{;}

the number of \code{realtype} words and \emph{liw} contains the number of
integer words.  This function is advisory only, for use in
determining a user's total space requirements; it could be a dummy
function in a user-supplied NVECTOR module if that information is
not of interest.

array of \code{realtype}.  Note that this assumes that the internal

\textbf{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
When looping over the components of an \code{N\_Vector v}, it is more
efficient to first obtain the component array via \code{v\_data =
NV\_DATA\_S(v)} and then access \code{v\_data{[}i{]}} within the loop than it
is to use \code{NV\_Ith\_S(v,i)} within the loop.

\item {} 
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Serial:c.N_VNewEmpty_Serial]{\emph{\code{N\_VNewEmpty\_Serial()}}}}, {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Serial:c.N_VMake_Serial]{\emph{\code{N\_VMake\_Serial()}}}}, and
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Serial:c.N_VCloneVectorArrayEmpty_Serial]{\emph{\code{N\_VCloneVectorArrayEmpty\_Serial()}}}} set the field \emph{own\_data}
to \code{FALSE}.  The functions \code{N\_VDestroy\_Serial()} and
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Serial:c.N_VDestroyVectorArray_Serial]{\emph{\code{N\_VDestroyVectorArray\_Serial()}}}} will not attempt to free the
pointer data for any \code{N\_Vector} with \emph{own\_data} set to \code{FALSE}.
In such a case, it is the user's responsibility to deallocate the
data pointer.

\item {} 
To maximize efficiency, vector operations in the NVECTOR\_SERIAL
implementation that have more than one \code{N\_Vector} argument do not
check for consistent internal representation of these vectors. It is
the user's responsibility to ensure that such routines are called
with \code{N\_Vector} arguments that were all created with the same
length.

\end{itemize}

For solvers that include a Fortran interface module, the
NVECTOR\_SERIAL module also includes a Fortran-callable function
\code{FNVINITS(code, NEQ, IER)}, to initialize this NVECTOR\_SERIAL
module.  Here \code{code} is an input solver id (1 for CVODE, 2 for IDA,
3 for KINSOL, 4 for ARKode); \code{NEQ} is the problem size (declared so
as to match C type \code{long int}); and \code{IER} is an error return flag
equal 0 for success and -1 for failure.

\label{nvectors/NVector_Parallel:nvectors-nvparallel}\label{nvectors/NVector_Parallel:the-nvector-parallel-module}\label{nvectors/NVector_Parallel::doc}
The NVECTOR\_PARALLEL implementation of the NVECTOR module provided with

ownership of the data array \emph{data}.

When looping over the components of an \code{N\_Vector v}, it is
more efficient to first obtain the local component array via \code{v\_data

is to use \code{NV\_Ith\_P(v,i)} within the loop.

For solvers that include a Fortran interface module, the

\code{FNVINITP(COMM, code, NLOCAL, NGLOBAL, IER)}, to initialize this
NVECTOR\_PARALLEL module.  Here \code{COMM} is the MPI communicator,
\code{code} is an input solver id (1 for CVODE, 2 for IDA, 3 for KINSOL,
4 for ARKode); \code{NLOCAL} and \code{NGLOBAL} are the local and global
vector sizes, respectively (declared so as to match C type \code{long
int}); and \code{IER} is an error return flag equal 0 for success and -1
for failure.

\begin{notice}{note}{Note:}
If the header file \code{sundials\_config.h} defines
\code{SUNDIALS\_MPI\_COMM\_F2C} to be 1 (meaning the MPI implementation
used to build SUNDIALS includes the \code{MPI\_Comm\_f2c} function),
then \code{COMM} can be any valid MPI communicator. Otherwise,
\code{MPI\_COMM\_WORLD} will be used, so just pass an integer value as a

\section{The NVECTOR\_OPENMP Module}
\label{nvectors/NVector_OpenMP:the-nvector-openmp-module}\label{nvectors/NVector_OpenMP::doc}\label{nvectors/NVector_OpenMP:nvectors-openmp}
In situations where a user has a multi-core processing unit capable of
running multiple parallel threads with shared memory, SUNDIALS provides
an implementation of NVECTOR using OpenMP, called NVECTOR\_OPENMP, and
an implementation using Pthreads, called NVECTOR\_PTHREADS. Testing has
shown that vectors should be of length at least \(100,000\) before
the overhead associated with creating and using the threads is made up
by the parallelism in the vector calculations.

The OpenMP NVECTOR implementation provided with SUNDIALS,
NVECTOR\_OPENMP, defines the \emph{content} field of \code{N\_Vector} to be a structure
containing the length of the vector, a pointer to the beginning of a contiguous
data array, a boolean flag \emph{own\_data} which specifies the ownership of
\emph{data}, and the number of threads.  Operations on the vector are
threaded using OpenMP, the number of threads used is based on the
supplied argument in the vector constructor.

\textbf{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
When looping over the components of an \code{N\_Vector v}, it is more
efficient to first obtain the component array via \code{v\_data =
NV\_DATA\_PT(v)} and then access \code{v\_data{[}i{]}} within the loop than it
is to use \code{NV\_Ith\_S(v,i)} within the loop.

\item {} 
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Pthreads:c.N_VNewEmpty_Pthreads]{\emph{\code{N\_VNewEmpty\_Pthreads()}}}}, {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Pthreads:c.N_VMake_Pthreads]{\emph{\code{N\_VMake\_Pthreads()}}}}, and
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Pthreads:c.N_VCloneVectorArrayEmpty_Pthreads]{\emph{\code{N\_VCloneVectorArrayEmpty\_Pthreads()}}}} set the field \emph{own\_data}
to \code{FALSE}.  The functions \code{N\_VDestroy\_Pthreads()} and
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Pthreads:c.N_VDestroyVectorArray_Pthreads]{\emph{\code{N\_VDestroyVectorArray\_Pthreads()}}}} will not attempt to free the
pointer data for any \code{N\_Vector} with \emph{own\_data} set to \code{FALSE}.
In such a case, it is the user's responsibility to deallocate the
data pointer.

\item {} 
To maximize efficiency, vector operations in the NVECTOR\_PTHREADS
implementation that have more than one \code{N\_Vector} argument do not
check for consistent internal representation of these vectors. It is
the user's responsibility to ensure that such routines are called
with \code{N\_Vector} arguments that were all created with the same
internal representations.

\end{itemize}

For solvers that include a Fortran interface module, the
NVECTOR\_PTHREADS module slso includes a Fortran-callable function
\code{FNVINITPTS(code, NEQ, NUMTHREADS, IER)}, to initialize this
NVECTOR\_PTHREADS module.  Here \code{code} is an input solver id
(1 for CVODE, 2 for IDA, 3 for KINSOL, 4 for ARKode); \code{NEQ} is
the problem size (declared so as to match C type \code{long int});
\code{NUMTHREADS} is the number of threads; and \code{IER} is an error
return flag equal 0 for success and -1 for failure.


\section{The NVECTOR\_PARHYP Module}
\label{nvectors/NVector_ParHyp:nvectors-parhyp}\label{nvectors/NVector_ParHyp:the-nvector-parhyp-module}\label{nvectors/NVector_ParHyp::doc}
The NVECTOR\_PARHYP implementation of the NVECTOR  module provided with
SUNDIALS is a wrapper around HYPRE's ParVector class.
Most of the vector kernels simply call HYPRE vector operations.
The implementation defines the \emph{content} field of \code{N\_Vector} to
be a structure containing the global and local lengths of the vector, a
pointer to an object of type \code{hypre\_ParVector}, an MPI communicator,
and a boolean flag \emph{own\_parvector} indicating ownership of the
HYPRE parallel vector object \emph{x}.

\end{Verbatim}

The header file to be included when using this module is \code{nvector\_parhyp.h}.
Unlike native SUNDIALS vector types, NVECTOR\_PARHYP does not provide macros
to access its member variables.

The NVECTOR\_PARHYP module defines implementations of all vector
operations listed in the section {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Operations:nvectors-ops]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Description of the NVECTOR operations}}}}, except for
\code{N\_VSetArrayPointer} and \code{N\_VGetArrayPointer}, because accessing
raw vector data is handled by low-level HYPRE functions.  As such,
this vector is not available for use with SUNDIALS Fortran
interfaces.  When access to raw vector data is needed, one should
extract the HYPRE HYPRE vector first, and then use HYPRE methods to
access the data.  Usage examples of NVECTOR\_PARHYP are provided in
the \code{cvAdvDiff\_non\_ph.c} example programs for CVODE and the
\code{ark\_diurnal\_kry\_ph.c} example program for ARKode.

The names of parhyp methods are obtained from those in the section
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Operations:nvectors-ops]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Description of the NVECTOR operations}}}} by appending the suffix \code{\_ParHyp}
(e.g. \code{N\_VDestroy\_ParHyp}).  The module \{nvecph\} provides the

Note that NVECTOR\_PETSC requires SUNDIALS to be built with MPI support.

There are NVECTOR examples that may be installed for each

\section{NVECTOR functions required by ARKode}
\label{nvectors/ARKode_requirements::doc}\label{nvectors/ARKode_requirements:nvector-functions-required-by-arkode}\label{nvectors/ARKode_requirements:nvectors-arkode}
In the table below, we list the vector functions in the \code{N\_Vector}
module that are called within the ARKode package.  The table also
shows, for each function, which ARKode module uses the function.
The ARKode column shows function usage within the main integrator
module,  while the remaining columns show function usage within
the ARKode linear solvers, the ARKBANDPRE and ARKBBDPRE
preconditioner modules, and the FARKODE module.  Here ARKDLS stands
for ARKDENSE and ARKBAND; ARKSPILS stands for ARKSPGMR, ARKSPBCG,
ARKSPTFQMR, ARKSPFGMR and ARKPCG; and ARKSLS stands for ARKKLU and

At this point, we should emphasize that the user does not need to know
anything about ARKode's usage of vector functions in order to use
ARKode.  Instead, this information is provided primarily for users
interested in constructing a custom \code{N\_Vector} module.  We note that
a number of \code{N\_Vector} functions from the section
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Description:nvectors-description]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Description of the NVECTOR Modules}}}} are not listed in the above table.
Therefore a user-supplied \code{N\_Vector} module for ARKode could safely
omit these functions from their implementation.

\chapter{Linear Solvers in ARKode}
\label{linear_solvers/index:linearsolvers}\label{linear_solvers/index::doc}\label{linear_solvers/index:linear-solvers-in-arkode}
In this chapter, we describe linear solver code components that are
included in SUNDIALS, but which are of potential use as generic
packages in themselves, either in conjunction with the use of SUNDIALS
or separately.

These generic linear solver modules are organized in three families of
solvers, the DLS family, which includes direct linear solvers
appropriate for sequential computations; the SLS family, which
includes sparse matrix solvers; and the SPILS family, which includes
scaled preconditioned iterative (Krylov) linear solvers. The solvers
in each family share common data structures and functions.

The {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:linearsolvers-dls]{\emph{\DUspan{}{DLS}}}} family contains the following two
generic linear solvers:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
The DENSE package, a linear solver for dense matrices either
specified through a matrix type (defined below) or as simple
arrays.

\item {} 
The BAND package, a linear solver for banded matrices either
specified through a matrix type (defined below) or as simple
arrays.

\end{itemize}

We further note that this family also includes the BLAS/LAPACK linear
solvers (dense and band) available to the SUNDIALS solvers, but these
are not discussed here.

The {\hyperref[linear_solvers/SLS:linearsolvers-sls]{\emph{\DUspan{}{SLS}}}} family contains a sparse matrix
package and interfaces between it and two sparse direct solver packages:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
The KLU package, a linear solver for compressed-sparse-column (CSC)
or compressed-sparse-row (CSR) matrices, \phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/index:id1}{\hyperref[References:klu]{\emph{{[}KLU{]}}}}, \phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/index:id2}{\hyperref[References:dp2010]{\emph{{[}DP2010{]}}}}.

\item {} 
The SUPERLUMT package, a threaded linear solver for
CSC matrices, \phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/index:id3}{\hyperref[References:superlumt]{\emph{{[}SuperLUMT{]}}}}, \phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/index:id4}{\hyperref[References:l2005]{\emph{{[}L2005{]}}}}, \phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/index:id5}{\hyperref[References:dgl1999]{\emph{{[}DGL1999{]}}}}.

\end{itemize}

The {\hyperref[linear_solvers/SPILS:linearsolvers-spils]{\emph{\DUspan{}{SPILS}}}} family contains the following
generic linear solvers:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
The SPGMR package, a solver for the scaled preconditioned GMRES
method.

\item {} 
The SPFGMR package, a solver for the scaled preconditioned Flexible
GMRES method.

\item {} 
The SPBCG package, a solver for the scaled preconditioned Bi-CGStab
method.

\item {} 
The SPTFQMR package, a solver for the scaled preconditioned TFQMR
method.

\item {} 
The PCG package, a solver for the preconditioned conjugate gradient
method.

\end{itemize}

For reasons related to installation, the names of the files involved
in these packages begin with teh prefix \code{sundials\_}.  But despite
this, each of the DLS and SPILS solvers is in fact generic, in that
it is usable completely independently of SUNDIALS.

For the sake of space, the functions for the DENSE, BAND modules
that work with a matrix type, and the functions in the SPGMR, SPFGMR,
SPBCG, SPTFQMR and PCG modules are only summarized briefly, since
they are less likely to be of direct use in connection with a SUNDIALS
solver.  However, the functions for dense matrices treated as simple
arrays and sparse matrices are fully described, because we anticipate
that they will be useful in the implementation of preconditioners used
with the combination of one of the SUNDIALS solvers and one of the
SPILS linear solvers.

Lastly, it is possible to supply customized linear solvers to ARKode,
in that the ARKode solvers only require the existence of a minimal set
of generic routines.  Through attaching user-supplied routines for
these function pointers, it is possible to use arbitrary approaches
for solution to the implicit linear systems arising during an ARKode
solve.

Specifics of these built-in linear solver packages, as well as the
generic linear solver interface, are provided in the following
sub-sections:


\section{The DLS modules: DENSE and BAND}
\label{linear_solvers/DLS:linearsolvers-dls}\label{linear_solvers/DLS::doc}\label{linear_solvers/DLS:the-dls-modules-dense-and-band}
The files comprising the DENSE generic linear solver, and their
locations in the SUNDIALS \code{srcdir}, are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
header files (located in \code{srcdir/include/sundials}):

\code{sundials\_direct.h}, \code{sundials\_dense.h}, \code{sundials\_types.h},
\code{sundials\_math.h}, \code{sundials\_config.h}

\item {} 
source files (located in \code{srcdir/src/sundials}):

\code{sundials\_direct.c}, \code{sundials\_dense.c}, \code{sundials\_math.c}

\end{itemize}

The files comprising the BAND generic linear solver are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
header files (located in \code{srcdir/include/sundials}):

\code{sundials\_direct.h}, \code{sundials\_band.h}, \code{sundials\_types.h},
\code{sundials\_math.h}, \code{sundials\_config.h}

\item {} 
source files (located in \code{srcdir/src/sundials}):

\code{sundials\_direct.c}, \code{sundials\_band.c}, \code{sundials\_math.c}

\end{itemize}

Only two of the preprocessing directives in the header file
\code{sundials\_config.h} are relevant to the DENSE and BAND packages by
themselves.
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
(required) definition of the precision of the SUNDIALS type
\code{realtype}. One of the following lines must be present:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define SUNDIALS\PYGZus{}DOUBLE\PYGZus{}PRECISION 1}
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define SUNDIALS\PYGZus{}SINGLE\PYGZus{}PRECISION 1}
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define SUNDIALS\PYGZus{}EXTENDED\PYGZus{}PRECISION 1}
\end{Verbatim}

\item {} 
(optional) use of generic math functions:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define SUNDIALS\PYGZus{}USE\PYGZus{}GENERIC\PYGZus{}MATH 1}
\end{Verbatim}

\end{itemize}

The \code{sundials\_types.h} header file defines the SUNDIALS \code{realtype}
and \code{booleantype} types and the macro \code{RCONST}, while the
\code{sundials\_math.h} header file is needed for the macros \code{SUNMIN}
and \code{SUNMAX}, and the function \code{SUNRabs}.

The files listed above for either module can be extracted from the
SUNDIALS \code{srcdir} and compiled by themselves into a separate library
or into a larger user code.


\subsection{DlsMat}
\label{linear_solvers/DLS:dlsmat}
The type {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DlsMat]{\emph{\code{DlsMat}}}}, defined in \code{sundials\_direct.h} is a
pointer to a structure defining a generic matrix, and is used with all
linear solvers in the DLS family:

\end{Verbatim}

\end{fulllineitems}


For the DENSE module, the relevant fields of this structure are as
follows. Note that a dense matrix of type {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DlsMat]{\emph{\code{DlsMat}}}} need not be
square.
\begin{quote}\begin{description}
\item[{type}] \leavevmode
-- \code{SUNDIALS\_DENSE} (=1)

\item[{M}] \leavevmode
-- number of rows

\item[{N}] \leavevmode
--  number of columns

\item[{ldim}] \leavevmode
-- leading dimension (\(\ge M\))

\item[{data}] \leavevmode
-- pointer to a contiguous block of \code{realtype} variables

\item[{ldata}] \leavevmode
-- length of the data array (\(= ldim*N\)). The
\code{(i,j)} element of a dense matrix \code{A} of type \code{DlsMat} (with
\(0 \le i < M\) and \(0 \le j < N\)) is given by the
expression \code{(A-\textgreater{}data){[}0{]}{[}j*M+i{]}}

\item[{cols}] \leavevmode
-- array of pointers. \code{cols{[}j{]}} points to the first element
of the \code{j}-th column of the matrix in the array data. The
\code{(i,j)} element of a dense matrix \code{A} of type \code{DlsMat} (with
\(0 \le i < M\) and \(0 \le j < N\)) is given by the
expression \code{(A-\textgreater{}cols){[}j{]}{[}i{]}}

\end{description}\end{quote}

For the BAND module, the relevant fields of this structure are as
follows (see Figure {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:dls-figure]{\emph{\DUspan{}{DLS Diagram}}}} for a diagram of
the underlying data representation in a banded matrix of type
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DlsMat]{\emph{\code{DlsMat}}}}). Note that only square band matrices are allowed.
\begin{quote}\begin{description}
\item[{type}] \leavevmode
-- \code{SUNDIALS\_BAND} (=2)

\item[{M}] \leavevmode
-- number of rows

\item[{N}] \leavevmode
-- number of columns (\(N = M\))

\item[{mu}] \leavevmode
-- upper half-bandwidth, \(0 \le mu < min(M,N)\)

\item[{ml}] \leavevmode
-- lower half-bandwidth, \(0 \le ml < min(M,N)\)

\item[{s\_mu}] \leavevmode
-- storage upper bandwidth, \(mu \le s\_mu < N\). The LU
decomposition routine writes the LU factors into the storage for
\(A\). The upper triangular factor \(U\), however, may
have an upper bandwidth as big as \(min(N-1,mu+ml)\) because
of partial pivoting. The \code{s\_mu} field holds the upper
half-bandwidth allocated for \(A\).

\item[{ldim}] \leavevmode
-- leading dimension (\(ldim \ge s\_mu\))

\item[{data}] \leavevmode
-- pointer to a contiguous block of \code{realtype}
variables. The elements of a banded matrix of type
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DlsMat]{\emph{\code{DlsMat}}}} are stored columnwise (i.e. columns are stored
one on top of the other in memory). Only elements within the
specified half-bandwidths are stored. \code{data} is a pointer to
\code{ldata} contiguous locations which hold the elements within the
band of \(A\).

\item[{ldata}] \leavevmode
-- length of the \code{data} array (\(= ldim*(s\_mu+ml+1)\))

\item[{cols}] \leavevmode
-- array of pointers. \code{cols{[}j{]}} is a pointer to the
uppermost element within the band in the \code{j}-th column. This
pointer may be treated as an array indexed from \code{s\_mu-mu} (to
access the uppermost element within the band in the \code{j}-th
column) to \code{s\_mu+ml} (to access the lowest element within the
band in the \code{j}-th column). Indices from 0 to \code{s\_mu-mu-1} give
access to extra storage elements required by the LU decomposition
function. Finally, \code{cols{[}j{]}{[}i-j+s\_mu{]}} is the \code{(i,j)}-th
element, \(j-mu \le i \le j+ml\).

\subsection{Accessor macros for the DLS modules}
\label{linear_solvers/DLS:accessor-macros-for-the-dls-modules}
The macros below allow a user to efficiently access individual matrix
elements without writing out explicit data structure references and
without knowing too much about the underlying element storage.  The
only storage assumption needed is that elements are stored columnwise
and that a pointer to the j-th column of elements can be obtained via
the {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DENSE_COL]{\emph{\code{DENSE\_COL}}}} or {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.BAND_COL]{\emph{\code{BAND\_COL}}}} macros. Users should use these
macros whenever possible.

The following two macros are defined by the DENSE module to provide
access to data in the {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DlsMat]{\emph{\code{DlsMat}}}} type:
\index{DENSE\_ELEM (C macro)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/DLS:c.DENSE_ELEM}\pysigline{\bfcode{DENSE\_ELEM}}
\textbf{Usage:} \code{DENSE\_ELEM(A,i,j) = a\_ij;}  or  \code{a\_ij = DENSE\_ELEM(A,i,j);}

This macro references the \((i,j)\)-th element of the \(M \times N\)
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DlsMat]{\emph{\code{DlsMat}}}} \(A\), \(0 \le i < M\) , \(0 \le j < N\).

\end{fulllineitems}

\index{DENSE\_COL (C macro)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/DLS:c.DENSE_COL}\pysigline{\bfcode{DENSE\_COL}}
\textbf{Usage:} \code{col\_j = DENSE\_COL(A,j);}

This macro references the \(j\)-th column of the \(M \times N\)
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DlsMat]{\emph{\code{DlsMat}}}} \(A\), \(0 \le j < N\). The type of the
expression \code{DENSE\_COL(A,j)} is \code{realtype *} . After the
assignment in the usage above, \code{col\_j} may be treated as an
array indexed from 0 to \(M-1\). The \((i,j)\)-th
element of \(A\) is referenced by \code{col\_j{[}i{]}}.

\end{fulllineitems}


The following three macros are defined by the BAND module to provide
access to data in the {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DlsMat]{\emph{\code{DlsMat}}}} type:
\index{BAND\_ELEM (C macro)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/DLS:c.BAND_ELEM}\pysigline{\bfcode{BAND\_ELEM}}
\textbf{Usage:} \code{BAND\_ELEM(A,i,j) = a\_ij;}  or  \code{a\_ij =
BAND\_ELEM(A,i,j);}

This macro references the \((i,j)\)-th element of the \(N \times N\)
band matrix \(A\), where \(0 \le i\), \(j \le N-1\).
The location \((i,j)\) should further satisfy \(j-\)
\code{(A-\textgreater{}mu)} \(\le i \le j+\) \code{(A-\textgreater{}ml)}.

\end{fulllineitems}

\index{BAND\_COL (C macro)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/DLS:c.BAND_COL}\pysigline{\bfcode{BAND\_COL}}
\textbf{Usage:} \code{col\_j = BAND\_COL(A,j);}

This macro references the diagonal element of the \(j\)-th column of the
\(N \times N\) band matrix \(A\), \(0 \le j \le
N-1\). The type of the expression \code{BAND\_COL(A,j)} is
\code{realtype *}. The pointer returned by the call \code{BAND\_COL(A,j)}
can be treated as an array which is indexed from \code{-(A-\textgreater{}mu)} to
\code{(A-\textgreater{}ml)}.

\end{fulllineitems}

\index{BAND\_COL\_ELEM (C macro)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/DLS:c.BAND_COL_ELEM}\pysigline{\bfcode{BAND\_COL\_ELEM}}
\textbf{Usage:} \code{BAND\_COL\_ELEM(col\_j,i,j) = a\_ij;}  or  \code{a\_ij =
BAND\_COL\_ELEM(col\_j,i,j);}

This macro references the \((i,j)\)-th entry of the band matrix
\(A\) when used in conjunction with {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.BAND_COL]{\emph{\code{BAND\_COL}}}} to reference
the \(j\)-th column through \code{col\_j}. The index \((i,j)\)
should satisfy \(j-\) \code{(A-\textgreater{}mu)} \(\le i \le j+\) \code{(A-\textgreater{}ml)}.

\end{fulllineitems}



\subsection{Functions in the DENSE module}
\label{linear_solvers/DLS:functions-in-the-dense-module}
The DENSE module defines two sets of functions with corresponding
names. The first set contains functions (with names starting with a
capital letter) that act on dense matrices of type {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DlsMat]{\emph{\code{DlsMat}}}}. The
second set contains functions (with names starting with a lower case
letter) that act on matrices represented as simple arrays.

DENSE package. For full details, see the header files

The following functions for small dense matrices are available in the
DENSE package.  These functions primarily replicate those defined above
for {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DlsMat]{\emph{\code{DlsMat}}}} dense matrices, but act on the individual data
arrays outside of the {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DlsMat]{\emph{\code{DlsMat}}}} structure:

A successful LU factorization leaves the matrix \emph{a} and the pivot
array \emph{p} with the following information:

the beginning of elimination step \(k, k = 0, 1, \ldots,
n-1\).

If the unique LU factorization of \emph{a} is given by \(P a =
LU\), where \(P\) is a permutation matrix, \(L\) is a
\(m \times n\) lower trapezoidal matrix with all diagonal
elements equal to 1, and \(U\) is a \(n \times n\) upper
triangular matrix, then the upper triangular part of \emph{a}

lower trapezoidal part of \emph{a} contains the multipliers,
\(I-L\). If \emph{a} is square, \(L\) is a unit lower
triangular matrix.

\subsection{Functions in the BAND module}
\label{linear_solvers/DLS:functions-in-the-band-module}
The BAND module defines two sets of functions with corresponding
names. The first set contains functions (with names starting with a
capital letter) that act on band matrices of type {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DlsMat]{\emph{\code{DlsMat}}}}. The
second set contains functions (with names starting with a lower case
letter) that act on matrices represented as simple arrays.

The following functions for {\hyperref[linear_solvers/DLS:c.DlsMat]{\emph{\code{DlsMat}}}} banded matrices are
available in the BAND package. For full details, see the header files
\code{sundials\_direct.h} and \code{sundials\_band.h}.  A number of these are

\item {} 
source files (located in \code{srcdir/src/sundials}):

\code{sundials\_sparse.c}, \code{sundials\_math.c}

\end{itemize}

Only two of the preprocessing directives in the header file
\code{sundials\_config.h} are relevant to the SLS package by
itself:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
(required) definition of the precision of the SUNDIALS type
\code{realtype}. One of the following lines must be present:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define SUNDIALS\PYGZus{}DOUBLE\PYGZus{}PRECISION 1}
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define SUNDIALS\PYGZus{}SINGLE\PYGZus{}PRECISION 1}
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define SUNDIALS\PYGZus{}EXTENDED\PYGZus{}PRECISION 1}
\end{Verbatim}

\item {} 
(optional) use of generic math functions:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define SUNDIALS\PYGZus{}USE\PYGZus{}GENERIC\PYGZus{}MATH 1}
\end{Verbatim}

\end{itemize}

The \code{sundials\_types.h} header file defines the SUNDIALS \code{realtype}
and \code{booleantype} types and the macro \code{RCONST}, while the
\code{sundials\_math.h} header file is needed for the macros \code{SUNMIN} and
\code{SUNMAX}, and the function \code{SUNRabs}.

The files listed above for either module can be extracted from the
SUNDIALS \code{srcdir} and compiled by themselves into a separate library
or into a larger user code.


\subsection{SlsMat}
\label{linear_solvers/SLS:slsmat}
SUNDIALS supports operations with compressed-sparse-column (CSC) and
compressed-sparse-row (CSR) matrix formats.  For convenience, integer
sparse matrix identifiers are defined as:\textbackslash{}

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define CSC\PYGZus{}MAT 0}
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define CSR\PYGZus{}MAT 1}
\end{Verbatim}

The type {\hyperref[linear_solvers/SLS:c.SlsMat]{\emph{\code{SlsMat}}}}, defined in \code{sundials\_sparse.h} is a
pointer to a structure defining generic CSC and CSR matrix formats,
and is used with all linear solvers in the SLS family:

The fields of this structure are as follows (see Figure
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/SLS:sls-figure]{\emph{\DUspan{}{SlsMat Diagram}}}}
for a diagram of the underlying compressed-sparse-column
representation in a sparse matrix of type {\hyperref[linear_solvers/SLS:c.SlsMat]{\emph{\code{SlsMat}}}}).  Note that a
sparse matrix of type {\hyperref[linear_solvers/SLS:c.SlsMat]{\emph{\code{SlsMat}}}} need not be square.
\begin{quote}\begin{description}
\item[{M}] \leavevmode
-- number of rows

\item[{N}] \leavevmode
--  number of columns

\item[{NNZ}] \leavevmode
-- maximum number of nonzero entries in the matrix (allocated
length of \textbf{data} and \textbf{rowvals} arrays)

\item[{NP}] \leavevmode
-- number of index pointers (e.g. number of column pointers for
CSC matrix). For CSC matrices \$NP=N\$, and for CSR matrices \$NP=M\$. This
value is set automatically based on the input for \textbf{sparsetype}.

\item[{data}] \leavevmode
-- pointer to a contiguous block of \code{realtype} variables (of
length \textbf{NNZ}), containing the values of the nonzero entries in the
matrix.

\item[{sparsetype}] \leavevmode
-- type of the sparse matrix (\code{CSC\_MAT} or \code{CSR\_MAT})

\item[{indexvals}] \leavevmode
-- pointer to a contiguous block of \code{int} variables (of
length \textbf{NNZ}), containing the row indices (if CSC) or column
indices (if CSR) of each nonzero matrix entry held in \textbf{data}.

\item[{indexptrs}] \leavevmode
-- pointer to a contiguous block of \code{int} variables (of
length \textbf{NP+1}).  For CSC matrices each entry provides the index of
the first column entry into the \textbf{data} and \textbf{indexvals} arrays,
e.g. if \textbf{indexptr{[}3{]}=7}, then the first nonzero entry in the
fourth column of the matrix is located in \textbf{data{[}7{]}}, and is
located in row \textbf{indexvals{[}7{]}} of the matrix.  The last entry
contains the total number of nonzero values in the matrix and hence
points just past the end of the active data in the \textbf{data} and
\textbf{indexvals} arrays.  For CSR matrices, each entry provides the
index of the first row intry into the \textbf{data} and \textbf{indexvals}
arrays.

the nonzero entries, with the row \code{i}, column \code{j} entry of
\code{A} (again, zero-based) denoted as \code{A(i,j)}.  The \code{indexptrs}

while the final entry points one past the final nonzero entry.

The following pointers are added to the \code{SlsMat} type for user
convenience, to provide a more intuitive interface to the CSC and CSR
sparse matrix data structures. They are set automatically by the
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/SLS:c.SparseNewMat]{\emph{\code{SparseNewMat()}}}} function, based on the sparse matrix storage
type.

where the first has no unused space, and the second has additional
storage (the entries marked with \code{*} may contain any values).  Note
in both cases that the final value in \code{indexptrs} is \code{8}.  The work
associated with operations on the sparse matrix is proportional to
this value and so one should use the best understanding of the number
of nonzeros here.

then it is assumed that \emph{x} is a \code{realtype} array of  length
\(N\), and \emph{y} is a \code{realtype} array of length
\(M\). Upon successful completion, the return value is zero;
otherwise -1 is returned.

\subsection{The KLU solver}
\label{linear_solvers/SLS:the-klu-solver}
KLU is a sparse matrix factorization and solver library written by Tim
Davis (\phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/SLS:id1}{\hyperref[References:klu]{\emph{{[}KLU{]}}}}, \phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/SLS:id2}{\hyperref[References:dp2010]{\emph{{[}DP2010{]}}}}).   KLU has a symbolic factorization routine
that computes the permutation of the linear system matrix to block
triangular form and the permutations that will pre-order the diagonal
blocks (the only ones that need to be factored) to reduce fill-in
(using AMD, COLAMD, CHOLAMD, natural, or an ordering given by the
user).  Note that SUNDIALS uses the COLAMD ordering by default with
KLU.

KLU breaks the factorization into two separate parts.  The first is a
symbolic factorization and the second is a numeric factorization that
returns the factored matrix along with final pivot information.  KLU
also has a refactor routine that can be called instead of the numeric
factorization.  This routine will reuse the pivot information.  This
routine also returns diagnostic information that a user can examine to
determine if numerical stability is being lost and a full numerical
factorization should be done instead of the refactor.

The KLU interface in SUNDIALS will perform the symbolic factorization
once.  It then calls the numerical factorization once and will call
the refactor routine until estimates of the numerical conditioning
suggest a new factorization should be completed.  The KLU interface
also has a \code{ReInit} routine that can be used to force a full
refactorization at the next solver setup call.

In order to use the SUNDIALS interface to KLU, it is
assumed that KLU has been installed on the system prior to
installation of SUNDIALS, and that SUNDIALS has been configured
appropriately to link with KLU (see {\hyperref[Install:installation]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode Installation Procedure}}}} for details).

Designed for serial calculations only, KLU is supported for
calculations employing SUNDIALS' serial or shared-memory parallel
\code{N\_Vector} modules (see {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Serial:nvectors-nvserial]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_SERIAL Module}}}},
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_OpenMP:nvectors-openmp]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_OPENMP Module}}}} and {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Pthreads:nvectors-pthreads]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_PTHREADS Module}}}}).


\subsection{The SuperLU\_MT solver}
\label{linear_solvers/SLS:the-superlu-mt-solver}
SuperLU\_MT is a threaded sparse matrix factorization and solver
library written by X. Sherry Li (\phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/SLS:id3}{\hyperref[References:superlumt]{\emph{{[}SuperLUMT{]}}}}, \phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/SLS:id4}{\hyperref[References:l2005]{\emph{{[}L2005{]}}}}, \phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/SLS:id5}{\hyperref[References:dgl1999]{\emph{{[}DGL1999{]}}}}).
The package performs matrix factorization using threads to enhance
efficiency in shared memory parallel environments.  It should be noted
that threads are only used in the factorization step.

In order to use the SUNDIALS interface to SuperLU\_MT, it is assumed
that SuperLU\_MT has been installed on the system prior to installation
of SUNDIALS, and that SUNDIALS has been configured appropriately to
link with SuperLU\_MT (see {\hyperref[Install:installation]{\emph{\DUspan{}{ARKode Installation Procedure}}}} for details).

Designed for serial and threaded calculations only, SuperLU\_MT is
supported for calculations employing SUNDIALS' serial or shared-memory
parallel \code{N\_Vector} modules (see {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Serial:nvectors-nvserial]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_SERIAL Module}}}},
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_OpenMP:nvectors-openmp]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_OPENMP Module}}}} and {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Pthreads:nvectors-pthreads]{\emph{\DUspan{}{The NVECTOR\_PTHREADS Module}}}}).


\section{The SPILS modules: SPGMR, SPFGMR, SPBCG, SPTFQMR and PCG}
\label{linear_solvers/SPILS:the-spils-modules-spgmr-spfgmr-spbcg-sptfqmr-and-pcg}\label{linear_solvers/SPILS:linearsolvers-spils}\label{linear_solvers/SPILS::doc}
The SPILS modules contain implementations of some of the most commonly
use scaled preconditioned Krylov solvers.  A linear solver module from
the SPILS family can be used in conjunction with any NVECTOR
implementation library.

In the subsections below, we discuss the iterative linear solvers
accessible to ARKode: SPGMR, SPFGMR, SPBCG, SPTFQMR and PCG.  Due to
the similarities between these modules, we provide a more complete
description of only the SPGMR interface, and for the remaining solvers
only discuss the salient differences.


\subsection{The SPGMR module}
\label{linear_solvers/SPILS:the-spgmr-module}
The SPGMR package, in the files \code{sundials\_spgmr.h} and
\code{sundials\_spgmr.c}, includes an implementation of the scaled
preconditioned GMRES method.  A separate code module, implemented in
\code{sundials\_iterative.h} and \code{sundials\_iterative.c}, contains
auxiliary functions that support SPGMR, as well as the other Krylov
solvers in SUNDIALS (SPFGMR, SPBCG, SPTFQMR and PCG).  For full
details, including usage instructions, see the header files
\code{sundials\_spgmr.h} and \code{sundials\_iterative.h}.

The files comprising the SPGMR generic linear solver, and their
locations in the SUNDIALS \code{srcdir}, are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
header files (located in \code{srcdir/include/sundials}):

\code{sundials\_spgmr.h}, \code{sundials\_iterative.h},
\code{sundials\_nvector.h}, \code{sundials\_types.h}, \code{sundials\_math.h},
\code{sundials\_config.h}

\item {} 
source files (located in \code{srcdir/src/sundials}):

\code{sundials\_spgmr.c}, \code{sundials\_iterative.c}, \code{sundials\_nvector.c}

\end{itemize}

Only two of the preprocessing directives in the header file
\code{sundials\_config.h} are required to use the SPGMR package by itself:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
(required) definition of the precision of the SUNDIALS type
\code{realtype}. One of the following three lines must be present:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define SUNDIALS\PYGZus{}DOUBLE\PYGZus{}PRECISION 1}
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define SUNDIALS\PYGZus{}SINGLE\PYGZus{}PRECISION 1}
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define SUNDIALS\PYGZus{}EXTENDED\PYGZus{}PRECISION 1}
\end{Verbatim}

\item {} 
(optional) use of generic math functions:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYG{c+cp}{\PYGZsh{}}\PYG{c+cp}{define SUNDIALS\PYGZus{}USE\PYGZus{}GENERIC\PYGZus{}MATH 1}
\end{Verbatim}

\end{itemize}

The \code{sundials\_types.h} header file defines the SUNDIALS \code{realtype}
and \code{booleantype} types and the macro \code{RCONST}, while the
\code{sundials\_math.h} header file is needed for the macros \code{SUNMIN},
\code{SUNMAX}, and \code{SUNSQR}, and the functions \code{SUNRabs} and \code{SUNRsqrt}.

The generic NVECTOR files, \code{sundials\_nvector.h} and
\code{sundials\_nvector.c} are needed for the definition of the generic
\code{N\_Vector} type and functions.  The NVECTOR functions used by the
SPGMR module are: {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Operations:c.N_VDotProd]{\emph{\code{N\_VDotProd()}}}}, {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Operations:c.N_VLinearSum]{\emph{\code{N\_VLinearSum()}}}},
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Operations:c.N_VScale]{\emph{\code{N\_VScale()}}}}, {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Operations:c.N_VProd]{\emph{\code{N\_VProd()}}}}, {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Operations:c.N_VDiv]{\emph{\code{N\_VDiv()}}}},
{\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Operations:c.N_VConst]{\emph{\code{N\_VConst()}}}}, {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Operations:c.N_VClone]{\emph{\code{N\_VClone()}}}},
\code{N\_VCloneVectorArray()}, {\hyperref[nvectors/NVector_Operations:c.N_VDestroy]{\emph{\code{N\_VDestroy()}}}}, and
\code{N\_VDestroyVectorArray()}.

The nine files listed above can be extracted from the SUNDIALS
\code{srcdir} and compiled by themselves into an SPGMR library or into a
separate user code.

The following functions are available in the SPGMR package:
\begin{itemize}
\item {}

preconditioned Bi-CGStab method. For full details, including usage
instructions, see the file \code{sundials\_spbcgs.h}.

requirement of symmetric linear systems for the conjugate gradient
method, this solver should only be used for problems with symmetric
linear operators.  Furthermore, aside from allowing a weight vector
for computing weighted convergence norms, no variable or equation
scaling is allowed for systems using this solver.  For full details,
including usage instructions, see the file \code{sundials\_pcg.h}.

\section{Providing Alternate Linear Solver Modules}
\label{linear_solvers/custom:providing-alternate-linear-solver-modules}\label{linear_solvers/custom::doc}\label{linear_solvers/custom:linearsolvers-custom}

\subsection{Newton system linear solver}
\label{linear_solvers/custom:newton-system-linear-solver}
The central ARKode module interfaces with the Newton system linear
solver module using calls to one of four routines. These are denoted
here by {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.linit]{\emph{\code{linit()}}}}, {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}}, {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsolve]{\emph{\code{lsolve()}}}}, and
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lfree]{\emph{\code{lfree()}}}}. Briefly, their purposes are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.linit]{\emph{\code{linit()}}}}: initializes memory specific to the linear solver;

\item {} 
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}}: evaluates and preprocesses the Jacobian or
preconditioner in preparation for solves;

\item {} 
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsolve]{\emph{\code{lsolve()}}}}: solves the linear system;

\item {} 
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lfree]{\emph{\code{lfree()}}}}: frees the linear solver memory.

\end{itemize}

A linear solver module must also provide a user-callable \textbf{specification
function} (like those described in the section
{\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-linearsolvers]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Linear solver specification functions}}}}) which will attach the above four
routines to the main ARKode memory block. The ARKode memory block is a
structure defined in the header file \code{arkode\_impl.h}. A pointer to
such a structure is defined as the type \code{ARKodeMem}. The four
fields in the \code{ARKodeMem} structure that refer to the Newton system
linear solver's functions are \code{ark\_linit}, \code{ark\_lsetup},
\code{ark\_lsolve}, and \code{ark\_lfree}, respectively.  Note that of these
interface functions , only the {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsolve]{\emph{\code{lsolve()}}}} function is
required. The {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lfree]{\emph{\code{lfree()}}}} routine must be provided only if the
solver specification routine makes any memory allocation.  For any of
the functions that are \emph{not} provided, the corresponding field should
be set to \code{NULL}. The linear
solver specification function must also set the value of the field
\code{ark\_setupNonNull} in the ARKode memory block -- to \code{TRUE} if
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}} is used, or \code{FALSE} otherwise.

Typically, the linear solver will require a block of memory specific
to the solver, and a principal function of the specification function
is to allocate that memory block, and initialize it.  Then the field
\code{ark\_lmem} in the ARKode memory block \code{ARKodeMem} is available to
attach a pointer to that linear solver memory.  This block can then be
used to facilitate the exchange of data between the four interface
functions.

If the linear solver involves adjustable parameters, the specification
function should set the default values of those.  User-callable
functions may be defined that could, optionally, override the default
parameter values.

We encourage the use of performance counters in connection with the various
operations involved with the linear solver.  Such counters would be
members of the linear solver memory block, would be initialized in the
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.linit]{\emph{\code{linit()}}}} function, and would be incremented by the
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}} and {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsolve]{\emph{\code{lsolve()}}}} functions.  Then
user-callable functions would be needed to obtain the values of these
counters.

For consistency with the existing ARKode linear solver modules, we
recommend that the return value of the specification function be 0 for
a successful return, and a negative value if an error occurs.
Possible error conditions include: the pointer to the main ARKode
memory block is \code{NULL}, an input is illegal, the NVECTOR
implementation is not compatible, or a memory allocation fails.


\subsection{Mass matrix linear solver}
\label{linear_solvers/custom:mass-matrix-linear-solver}
Similarly, for problems involving a non-identity mass matrix
\(M\ne I\), the main ARKode module interfaces with the mass matrix
linear solver module using calls to one of four routines:
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.minit]{\emph{\code{minit()}}}}, {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msetup]{\emph{\code{msetup()}}}}, {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msolve]{\emph{\code{msolve()}}}}, and
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.mfree]{\emph{\code{mfree()}}}}. Briefly, their purposes are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.minit]{\emph{\code{minit()}}}}: initializes memory specific to the mass matrix
linear solver;

\item {} 
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msetup]{\emph{\code{msetup()}}}}: evaluates and preprocesses the mass matrix or
associated preconditioner in preparation for solves;

\item {} 
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msolve]{\emph{\code{msolve()}}}}: solves the mass matrix system;

\item {} 
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.mfree]{\emph{\code{mfree()}}}}: frees the mass matrix linear solver memory.

\end{itemize}

As with the Newton system linear solver, a mass matrix linear solver
module must also provide a user-callable \textbf{specification function} (like
those described in the section {\hyperref[c_interface/User_callable:cinterface-linearsolvers]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Linear solver specification functions}}}}) which
will attach the above four functions to the main ARKode memory
block.  The four fields in the \code{ARKodeMem} structure that refer to
the mass matrix system linear solver's functions are \code{ark\_minit},
\code{ark\_msetup}, \code{ark\_msolve}, and \code{ark\_mfree}, respectively.  As
with the Newton system solver, only {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msolve]{\emph{\code{msolve()}}}} is required,
and {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.mfree]{\emph{\code{mfree()}}}} must be provided only if the solver
specification function makes any memory allocation.  For any of the
functions that are \emph{not} provided, the corresponding field should be
set to \code{NULL}.  The mass matrix linear solver specification function
must also set the value of the field \code{ark\_MassSetupNonNull} in the
ARKode memory block -- to \code{TRUE} if {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msetup]{\emph{\code{msetup()}}}} is used, or
\code{FALSE} otherwise.

As with the Newton system linear solver, the mass matrix linear solver
will require a block of memory specific to the solver, so a principal
function of the specification function is to allocate that memory
block, and initialize it.  Then the field \code{ark\_mass\_mem} in the
ARKode memory block \code{ARKodeMem} is available to attach a pointer to
that mass matrix solver memory.  This block can then be used to
facilitate the exchange of data between the various interface functions.

If the linear solver involves adjustable parameters, the specification
function should set the default values of those.  User-callable
functions may be defined that could, optionally, override the default
parameter values.

We encourage the use of performance counters in connection with the various
operations involved with the linear solver.  Such counters would be
members of the linear solver memory block, would be initialized in the
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.minit]{\emph{\code{minit()}}}} function, and would be incremented by the
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msetup]{\emph{\code{msetup()}}}} and {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msolve]{\emph{\code{msolve()}}}} functions.  Then
user-callable functions would be needed to obtain the values of these
counters.

For consistency with the existing ARKode linear solver modules, we
recommend that the return value of the specification function be 0 for
a successful return, and a negative value if an error occurs.
Possible error conditions include: the pointer to the main ARKode
memory block is \code{NULL}, an input is illegal, the NVECTOR
implementation is not compatible, or a memory allocation fails.

These above functions, which interface between ARKode and the Newton
system or mass matrix linear solver module necessarily have fixed call
sequences.  Thus, a user wishing to implement another linear solver
within the ARKode package must adhere to this set of interfaces.  The
following is a complete description of the call list for each of these
functions.  Note that the call list of each function includes a pointer
to the main ARKode memory block, by which the function can access
various data related to the ARKode solution. The contents of this
memory block are given in the file \code{arkode\_impl.h} (but not
reproduced here, for the sake of space).


\subsection{Initialization function}
\label{linear_solvers/custom:initialization-function}
The type definition of {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.linit]{\emph{\code{linit()}}}} is
\index{linit (C function)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/custom:c.linit}\pysiglinewithargsret{typedef int \bfcode{(*linit)}}{ARKodeMem\emph{ ark\_mem}}{}
Completes initializations for the specific linear solver, such as
counters and statistics.  It should also set pointers to data
blocks that will later be passed to functions associated with the
linear solver.  The {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.linit]{\emph{\code{linit()}}}} function is called once only,
at the start of the problem, during the first call to ARKode.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{ark\_mem} -- pointer to the ARKode memory block.

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Return value:}  Should return 0 if it has successfully
initialized the ARKode linear solver and a negative value
otherwise.

\end{fulllineitems}


Similarly, the type definition of {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.minit]{\emph{\code{minit()}}}} is
\index{minit (C function)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/custom:c.minit}\pysiglinewithargsret{typedef int \bfcode{(*minit)}}{ARKodeMem\emph{ ark\_mem}}{}
Completes initializations for the specific mass matrix linear
solver, such as counters and statistics.  It should also set
pointers to data blocks that will later be passed to functions
associated with the linear solver.  The {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.minit]{\emph{\code{minit()}}}} function
is called once only, at the start of the problem, during the first
call to ARKode.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{ark\_mem} -- pointer to the ARKode memory block.

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Return value:}  Should return 0 if it has successfully
initialized the ARKode linear solver and a negative value
otherwise.

\end{fulllineitems}



\subsection{Setup function}
\label{linear_solvers/custom:setup-function}
The type definition of {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}} is
\index{lsetup (C function)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup}\pysiglinewithargsret{typedef int \bfcode{(*lsetup)}}{ARKodeMem\emph{ ark\_mem}, int\emph{ convfail}, N\_Vector\emph{ ypred}, N\_Vector\emph{ fpred}, booleantype\emph{ *jcurPtr}, N\_Vector\emph{ vtemp1}, N\_Vector\emph{ vtemp2}, N\_Vector\emph{ vtemp3}}{}
Prepares the linear solver for subsequent calls to
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsolve]{\emph{\code{lsolve()}}}}, in the solution of systems \(A x = b\),
where \(A\) is some approximation to the Newton matrix,
\(M-\gamma \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\).  Here,
\(\gamma\) is available as \code{ark\_mem-\textgreater{}ark\_gamma}.

The {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}} function may call a user-supplied function,
or a function within the linear solver module, to compute needed
data related to the Jacobian matrix \(\frac{\partial
f}{\partial y}\).  Alterntively, it may choose to retrieve and use
stored values of this data.

In either case, {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}} may also preprocess that data as
needed for {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsolve]{\emph{\code{lsolve()}}}}, which may involve calling a generic
function (such as for LU factorization).  This data may be intended
either for direct use (in a direct linear solver) or for use in a
preconditioner (in a preconditioned iterative linear solver).

The {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}} function is not called at every stage solve
(or even every time step), but only as frequently as the solver
determines that it is appropriate to perform the setup task.  In
this way, Jacobian-related data generated by {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}} is
expected to be used over a number of time steps.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{arkode\_mem} -- pointer to the ARKode memory block.

\item {} 
\emph{convfail} -- an input flag used to indicate any problem that
occurred during the solution of the nonlinear equation on the
current time step for which the linear solver is being
used. This flag can be used to help decide whether the
Jacobian data kept by a linear solver needs to be
updated or not. Its possible values are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_NO\_FAILURES}: this value is passed if either this is the
first call for this step, or the local error test failed on
the previous attempt at this step (but the Newton iteration
converged).

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_FAIL\_BAD\_J}: this value is passed if (a) the previous
Newton corrector iteration did not converge and the linear
solver's setup function indicated that its Jacobian-related
data is not current, or (b) during the previous Newton
corrector iteration, the linear solver's solve function
failed in a recoverable manner and the linear solver's setup
function indicated that its Jacobian-related data is not
current.

\item {} 
\emph{ARK\_FAIL\_OTHER}: this value is passed if during the current
internal step try, the previous Newton iteration failed to
converge even though the linear solver was using current
Jacobian-related data.

\end{itemize}

\item {} 
\emph{ypred} -- is the predicted \(y\) vector for the current
ARKode internal step.

\item {} 
\emph{fpred} -- is the value of the implicit right-hand side at
\emph{ypred}, \(f_I(t_n,ypred)\).

\item {} 
\emph{jcurPtr} -- is a pointer to a boolean to be filled in by
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}}. The function should set \code{*jcurPtr = TRUE}
if its Jacobian data is current after the call, and should set
\code{*jcurPtr = FALSE} if its Jacobian data is not current. If
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}} calls for re-evaluation of Jacobian data
(based on \emph{convfail} and ARKode state data), it should return
\code{*jcurPtr = TRUE} unconditionally; otherwise an infinite
loop can result.

\item {} 
\emph{vtemp1}, \emph{vtemp2}, \emph{vtemp3} -- are temporary variables of
type \code{N\_Vector} provided for use by {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}}.

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Return value:}
Should return 0 if successful, a positive value
for a recoverable error, and a negative value for an unrecoverable
error.  On a recoverable error return, the solver will attempt to
recover by reducing the step size.

\end{fulllineitems}


Similarly, the type definition of {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msetup]{\emph{\code{msetup()}}}} is
\index{msetup (C function)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/custom:c.msetup}\pysiglinewithargsret{typedef int \bfcode{(*msetup)}}{ARKodeMem\emph{ ark\_mem}, N\_Vector\emph{ vtemp1}, N\_Vector\emph{ vtemp2}, N\_Vector\emph{ vtemp3}}{}
Prepares the mass matrix linear solver for subsequent calls to
{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msolve]{\emph{\code{msolve()}}}}, in the solution of systems \(M x = b\),
where \(M\) is the system mass matrix.

The {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msetup]{\emph{\code{msetup()}}}} function may call a user-supplied function,
or a function within the linear solver module, to compute needed
data related to the mass matrix.  Alterntively, it may choose to
retrieve and use stored values of this data.

In either case, {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msetup]{\emph{\code{msetup()}}}} may also preprocess that data as
needed for {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msolve]{\emph{\code{msolve()}}}}, which may involve calling a generic
function (such as for LU factorization).  This data may be intended
either for direct use (in a direct linear solver) or for use in a
preconditioner (in a preconditioned iterative linear solver).

The {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msetup]{\emph{\code{msetup()}}}} function is called at every time step, as
discussed in section {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-masssolve]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Mass matrix solver}}}}.
\begin{description}
\item[{\textbf{Arguments:}}] \leavevmode\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\emph{arkode\_mem} -- pointer to the ARKode memory block.

\item {} 
\emph{vtemp1}, \emph{vtemp2}, \emph{vtemp3} -- are temporary variables of
type \code{N\_Vector} provided for use by {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.msetup]{\emph{\code{msetup()}}}}.

\end{itemize}

\end{description}

\textbf{Return value:}
Should return 0 if successful, a positive value
for a recoverable error, and a negative value for an unrecoverable
error.  On a recoverable error return, the solver will attempt to
recover by reducing the step size.

\end{fulllineitems}



\subsection{Solve function}
\label{linear_solvers/custom:solve-function}
The type definition of {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsolve]{\emph{\code{lsolve()}}}} is
\index{lsolve (C function)}

\begin{fulllineitems}
\phantomsection\label{linear_solvers/custom:c.lsolve}\pysiglinewithargsret{typedef int \bfcode{(*lsolve)}}{ARKodeMem\emph{ ark\_mem}, N\_Vector\emph{ b}, N\_Vector\emph{ weight}, N\_Vector\emph{ ycur}, N\_Vector\emph{ fcur}}{}
Solves the linear equation \({\mathcal A} x = b\), where
\({\mathcal A}\) arises  in the Newton iteration (see the
section {\hyperref[Mathematics:mathematics-linear]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Linear solver methods}}}}) and gives some approximation to
the Newton matrix \(M - \gamma J\), \(J =
\frac{\partial}{\partial y} f_I(t_n, ycur)\). Note, the right-hand
side vector  \(b\) is input, and \(\gamma\) is available as
\code{ark\_mem-\textgreater{}ark\_gamma}.

{\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsolve]{\emph{\code{lsolve()}}}} is called once per Newton iteration, hence possibly
several times per time step.

If there is an {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}} function, this {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsolve]{\emph{\code{lsolve()}}}}
function should make use of any Jacobian data that was computed and
preprocessed by {\hyperref[linear_solvers/custom:c.lsetup]{\emph{\code{lsetup()}}}}, either for direct use, or for
use in a preconditioner.

\chapter{ARKode Installation Procedure}
\label{Install:installation}\label{Install:arkode-installation-procedure}\label{Install::doc}
The installation of any SUNDIALS package is accomplished by installing
the SUNDIALS suite as a whole, according to the instructions that
follow.  The same procedure applies whether or not the downloaded
file contains one or all solvers in SUNDIALS.

The SUNDIALS suite (or individual solvers) are distributed as
compressed archives (\code{.tar.gz}).  The name of the distribution
archive is of the form \code{SOLVER-X.Y.Z.tar.gz}, where \code{SOLVER} is
one of: \code{sundials}, \code{cvode}, \code{cvodes}, \code{arkode}, \code{ida},
\code{idas}, or \code{kinsol}, and \code{X.Y.Z} represents the version number
(of the SUNDIALS suite or of the individual solver).
To begin the installation, first uncompress and expand the sources, by
issuing

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZpc{} tar \PYGZhy{}zxf SOLVER\PYGZhy{}X.Y.Z.tar.gz
\end{Verbatim}

This will extract source files under a directory \code{SOLVER-X.Y.Z}.

Starting with version 2.6.0 of SUNDIALS, CMake is the only supported
method of installation.  The explanations on the installation
procedure begins with a few common observations:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
The remainder of this chapter will follow these conventions:
\begin{description}
\item[{\code{SRCDIR}}] \leavevmode
is the directory \code{SOLVER-X.Y.Z} created above; i.e. the
directory containing the SUNDIALS sources.

\item[{\code{BUILDDIR}}] \leavevmode
is the (temporary) directory under which SUNDIALS is built.

\item[{\code{INSTDIR}}] \leavevmode
is the directory under which the SUNDIALS exported header files
and libraries will be installed. Typically, header files are
exported under a directory \code{INSTDIR/include} while libraries
are installed under \code{INSTDIR/lib}, with \code{INSTDIR}
specified at configuration time.

\end{description}

\item {} 
For SUNDIALS' CMake-based installation, in-source builds are prohibited;
in other words, the build directory \code{BUILDDIR} can \textbf{not} be the
same as \code{SRCDIR} and such an attempt will lead to an error.  This
prevents ``polluting'' the source tree and allows efficient builds for
different configurations and/or options.

\item {} 
The installation directory \code{INSTDIR} can not be the same as
the source directory \code{SRCDIR}.

\item {} 
By default, only the libraries and header files are exported to the
installation directory \code{INSTDIR}.  If enabled by the user (with the
appropriate toggle for CMake), the
examples distributed with SUNDIALS will be built together with
the solver libraries but the installation step will result in
exporting (by default in a subdirectory of the installation
directory) the example sources and sample outputs together with
automatically generated configuration files that reference the
\emph{installed} SUNDIALS headers and libraries.  As such, these
configuration files for the SUNDIALS examples can be used as
``templates'' for your own problems. CMake installs
\code{CMakeLists.txt} files and also (as an option available only under
Unix/Linux) \code{Makefile} files. Note this installation approach also
allows the option of building the SUNDIALS examples without having
to install them.  (This can be used as a sanity check for the
freshly built libraries.)

\item {} 
Even if generation of shared libraries is enabled, only static
libraries are created for the FCMIX modules.  Because of the use of
fixed names for the Fortran user-provided subroutines, FCMIX shared
libraries would result in ``undefined symbol'' errors at link time.

\end{itemize}

Further details on the CMake-based installation procedures,
instructions for manual compilation, and a roadmap of the resulting
installed libraries and exported header files, are provided in the
following subsections:

\section{CMake-based installation}
\label{Install:installation-cmake}\label{Install:cmake-based-installation}
CMake-based installation provides a platform-independent build system. CMake can generate
Unix and Linux Makefiles, as well as KDevelop, Visual Studio, and
(Apple) XCode project files from the same configuration file.
In addition, CMake also provides a GUI front end and which allows an interactive build and
installation process.

The SUNDIALS build process requires CMake version 2.8.1 or
higher and a working compiler.  On Unix-like operating systems, it
also requires Make (and \code{curses}, including its development libraries,
for the GUI front end to CMake, \code{ccmake} or \code{cmake-gui}), while on
Windows it requires Visual Studio.  While many Linux distributions offer CMake,
the version included may be out of date.  Many new CMake
features have been added recently, and you should download the latest
version from \href{http://www.cmake.org}{http://www.cmake.org}.  Build instructions for CMake
(only necessary for Unix-like systems) can be found on the CMake website.
Once CMake is installed, Linux/Unix users will be able to use
\code{ccmake} or \code{cmake-gui} (depending on the version of CMake),
while Windows users will be able to use \code{CMakeSetup}.

As previously noted, when using CMake to configure, build and install
SUNDIALS, it is always required to use a separate build
directory. While in-source builds are possible, they are explicitly
prohibited by the SUNDIALS CMake scripts (one of the reasons being
that, unlike autotools, CMake does not provide a \code{make distclean}
procedure and it is therefore difficult to clean-up the source tree
after an in-source build). By ensuring a separate build directory, it
is an easy task for the user to clean-up all traces of the build by
simply removing the build directory. CMake does generate a \code{make
clean} which will remove files generated by the compiler and linker.

\index{ccmake}

\subsection{Configuring, building, and installing on Unix-like systems}
\label{Install:installation-cmake-unix}\label{Install:index-0}\label{Install:configuring-building-and-installing-on-unix-like-systems}
The default CMake configuration will build all included solvers and
associated examples and will build static and shared libraries. The
INSTDIR defaults to \code{/usr/local} and can be changed by setting
the \code{CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX} variable. Support for FORTRAN and all
other options are disabled.

CMake can be used from the command line with the \code{cmake} command, or
from a \code{curses}-based GUI by using the \code{ccmake} command, or from
a wxWidgets or QT based GUI by using the \code{cmake-gui}
command. Examples for using both text and graphical methods will be
presented.  For the examples shown it is assumed that there is a top
level SUNDIALS directory with appropriate source, build and install
directories:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZdl{} mkdir \PYG{o}{(}...\PYG{o}{)}/INSTDIR
\PYGZdl{} mkdir \PYG{o}{(}...\PYG{o}{)}/BUILDDIR
\PYGZdl{} \PYG{n+nb}{cd} \PYG{o}{(}...\PYG{o}{)}/BUILDDIR
\end{Verbatim}

\index{cmake-gui}
\index{ccmake}

\subsubsection{Building with the GUI}
\label{Install:building-with-the-gui}\label{Install:index-2}
Using CMake with the \code{ccmake} GUI follows the general process:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Select and modify values, run configure (\code{c} key)

\item {} 
New values are denoted with an asterisk

\item {} 
To set a variable, move the cursor to the variable and press enter
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
If it is a boolean (ON/OFF) it will toggle the value

\item {} 
If it is string or file, it will allow editing of the string

\item {} 
For file and directories, the \code{\textless{}tab\textgreater{}} key can be used to complete

\end{itemize}

\item {} 
Repeat until all values are set as desired and the generate option
is available (\code{g} key)

\item {} 
Some variables (advanced variables) are not visible right away

\item {} 
To see advanced variables, toggle to advanced mode (\code{t} key)

\item {} 
To search for a variable press \code{/} key, and to repeat the search,
press the \code{n} key

\end{itemize}

Using CMake with the \code{cmake-gui} GUI follows a similar process:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
Select and modify values, click \code{Configure}

\item {} 
The first time you click \code{Configure}, make sure to pick the
appropriate generator (the following will ssume generation of Unix
Makfiles).

\item {} 
New values are highlighted in red

\item {} 
To set a variable, click on or move the cursor to the variable and press enter
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
If it is a boolean (\code{ON/OFF}) it will check/uncheck the box

\item {} 
If it is string or file, it will allow editing of the string.
Additionally, an ellipsis button will appear \code{...} on the far
right of the entry.  Clicking this button will bring up the file
or directory selection dialog.

\item {} 
For files and directories, the \code{\textless{}tab\textgreater{}} key can be used to
complete

\end{itemize}

\item {} 
Repeat until all values are set as desired and click the
\code{Generate} button

\item {} 
Some variables (advanced variables) are not visible right away

\item {} 
To see advanced variables, click the \code{advanced} button

\end{itemize}

To build the default configuration using the curses GUI, from the
BUILDDIR enter the \code{ccmake} command and point to the SRCDIR:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZdl{} ccmake \PYG{o}{(}...\PYG{o}{)}/SRCDIR
\end{Verbatim}

Similarly, to build the default configuration using the wxWidgets GUI,
from the BUILDDIR enter the \code{cmake-gui} command and point to the
SRCDIR:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZdl{} cmake\PYGZhy{}gui \PYG{o}{(}...\PYG{o}{)}/SRCDIR
\end{Verbatim}

The default curses configuration screen is shown in
the following figure.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\capstart

\scalebox{0.750000}{\includegraphics{ccmakedefault.png}}
\caption{Default configuration screen. Note: Initial screen is empty.
To get this default configuration, press `c' repeatedly (accepting
default values denoted with asterisk) until the `g' option is
available.}\label{Install:ccmakedefault}\end{figure}

The default INSTDIR for both SUNDIALS and corresponding examples
can be changed by setting the \code{CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX} and
the \code{EXAMPLES\_INSTALL\_PATH} as shown in the following figure.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\capstart

\scalebox{0.750000}{\includegraphics{ccmakeprefix.png}}
\caption{Changing the INSTDIR for SUNDIALS and corresponding EXAMPLES.}\label{Install:ccmakeprefix}\end{figure}

Pressing the \code{g} key or clicking \code{generate} will generate
makefiles including all dependencies and all rules to build SUNDIALS
on this system.  Back at the command prompt, you can now run:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZdl{} make
\end{Verbatim}

or for a faster parallel build (e.g. using 4 threads), you can run

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZdl{} make \PYGZhy{}j 4
\end{Verbatim}

To install SUNDIALS in the installation directory specified in the configuration, simply run:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZdl{} make install
\end{Verbatim}

\index{cmake}

\subsubsection{Building from the command line}
\label{Install:building-from-the-command-line}\label{Install:index-3}
Using CMake from the command line is simply a matter of specifying
CMake variable settings with the \code{cmake} command.  The following
will build the default configuration:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZdl{} cmake \PYGZhy{}DCMAKE\PYGZus{}INSTALL\PYGZus{}PREFIX\PYG{o}{=}/home/myname/sundials/instdir \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{}  \PYGZhy{}DEXAMPLES\PYGZus{}INSTALL\PYGZus{}PATH\PYG{o}{=}/home/myname/sundials/instdir/examples \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{}  ../srcdir
\PYGZdl{} make
\PYGZdl{} make install
\end{Verbatim}

\subsection{Configuration examples}
\label{Install:configuration-examples}\label{Install:installation-cmake-examples}
The following examples will help demonstrate usage of the CMake
configure options.

To configure SUNDIALS using the default C and Fortran compilers,
and default \code{mpicc} and \code{mpif77} parallel compilers,
enable compilation of examples, and install libraries, headers, and
example sources under subdirectories of \code{/home/myname/sundials/}, use:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZpc{} cmake \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}DCMAKE\PYGZus{}INSTALL\PYGZus{}PREFIX\PYG{o}{=}/home/myname/sundials/instdir \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}DEXAMPLES\PYGZus{}INSTALL\PYGZus{}PATH\PYG{o}{=}/home/myname/sundials/instdir/examples \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}DMPI\PYGZus{}ENABLE\PYG{o}{=}ON \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}DFCMIX\PYGZus{}ENABLE\PYG{o}{=}ON \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} /home/myname/sundials/srcdir

\PYGZpc{} make install
\end{Verbatim}

To disable installation of the examples, use:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZpc{} cmake \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}DCMAKE\PYGZus{}INSTALL\PYGZus{}PREFIX\PYG{o}{=}/home/myname/sundials/instdir \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}DEXAMPLES\PYGZus{}INSTALL\PYGZus{}PATH\PYG{o}{=}/home/myname/sundials/instdir/examples \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}DMPI\PYGZus{}ENABLE\PYG{o}{=}ON \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}DFCMIX\PYGZus{}ENABLE\PYG{o}{=}ON \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}DEXAMPLES\PYGZus{}INSTALL\PYG{o}{=}OFF \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} /home/myname/sundials/srcdir

\PYGZpc{} make install
\end{Verbatim}


\subsection{Working with external Libraries}
\label{Install:installation-cmake-externallibraries}\label{Install:working-with-external-libraries}
The SUNDIALS suite contains many options to enable implementation
flexibility when developing solutions. The following are some notes
addressing specific configurations when using the supported third
party libraries.


\subsubsection{Building with LAPACK and BLAS}
\label{Install:installation-cmake-externallibraries-lapack}\label{Install:building-with-lapack-and-blas}
To enable LAPACK and BLAS libraries, set the \code{LAPACK\_ENABLE} option
to \code{ON}.  If the directory containing the LAPACK and BLAS libraries
is in the \code{LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH} environment variable, CMake will set the
\code{LAPACK\_LIBRARIES} variable accordingly, otherwise CMake will attemp
to find the LAPACK and BLAS libraries in standard system locations.
To explicitly tell CMake what libraries to use, the
\code{LAPACK\_LIBRARIES} varible can be set to the desired libraries.

Example:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZpc{} cmake \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}DCMAKE\PYGZus{}INSTALL\PYGZus{}PREFIX\PYG{o}{=}/home/myname/sundials/instdir \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}DEXAMPLES\PYGZus{}INSTALL\PYGZus{}PATH\PYG{o}{=}/home/myname/sundials/instdir/examples \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} \PYGZhy{}DLAPACK\PYGZus{}LIBRARIES\PYG{o}{=}/mypath/lib/liblapack.so\PYG{p}{;}/mypath/lib/libblas.so \PYG{l+s+se}{\PYGZbs{}}
\PYGZgt{} /home/myname/sundials/srcdir

\PYGZpc{} make install
\end{Verbatim}


\subsubsection{Building with KLU}
\label{Install:installation-cmake-externallibraries-klu}\label{Install:building-with-klu}
The KLU libraries are part of SuiteSparse, a suite of sparse matrix
software, available from the Texas A\&M University website:
\href{http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html}{http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html} .

SUNDIALS has been tested with SuiteSparse version 4.5.3.  To enable
KLU, set \code{KLU\_ENABLE} to \code{ON}, set \code{KLU\_INCLUDE\_DIR} to the
\code{include} path of the KLU installation and set \code{KLU\_LIBRARY\_DIR}
to the \code{lib} path of the KLU installation.  The CMake configure will
result in populating the following variables: \code{AMD\_LIBRARY},
\code{AMD\_LIBRARY\_DIR},  \code{BTF\_LIBRARY}, \code{BTF\_LIBRARY\_DIR},
\code{COLAMD\_LIBRARY}, \code{COLAMD\_LIBRARY\_DIR}, and \code{KLU\_LIBRARY}.


\subsubsection{Building with SuperLU\_MT}
\label{Install:building-with-superlu-mt}\label{Install:installation-cmake-externallibraries-superlu-mt}
The SuperLU\_MT libraries are available for download from the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory website:
\href{http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/\$sim\$xiaoye/SuperLU/}{http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/\$sim\$xiaoye/SuperLU/}\#superlu\_mt .

SUNDIALS has been tested with SuperLU\_MT version 3.1.  To enable
SuperLU\_MT, set  \code{SUPERLUMT\_ENABLE} to \code{ON}, set
\code{SUPERLUMT\_INCLUDE\_DIR} to the \code{SRC} path of the SuperLU\_MT
installation, and set the variable \code{SUPERLUMT\_LIBRARY\_DIR} to the
\code{lib} path of the SuperLU\_MT installation.  At the same time, the
variable \code{SUPERLUMT\_THREAD\_TYPE} must be set to either \code{Pthread}
or \code{OpenMP}.

Do not mix thread types when building SUNDIALS solvers.
If threading is enabled for SUNDIALS by having either
\code{OPENMP\_ENABLE} or \code{PTHREAD\_ENABLE} set to \code{ON} then SuperLU\_MT
should be set to use the same threading type.


\subsubsection{Building with PETSc}
\label{Install:building-with-petsc}\label{Install:installation-cmake-externallibraries-petsc}
The PETSc libraries are available for download from the Argonne
National Laboratory website:
\href{http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc}{http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc} .

SUNDIALS has been tested with PETSc version 3.7.2.  To enable PETSc,
set \code{PETSC\_ENABLE} to \code{ON}, set \code{PETSC\_INCLUDE\_DIR} to the
\code{include} path of the PETSc installation, and set the variable
\code{PETSC\_LIBRARY\_DIR} to the \code{lib} path of the PETSc installation.


\subsubsection{Building with \emph{hypre}}
\label{Install:building-with-hypre}\label{Install:installation-cmake-externallibraries-hypre}
The hypre libraries are available for download from the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory website:
\href{http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/hypre-scalable-linear-solvers-multigrid-methods}{http://computation.llnl.gov/projects/hypre-scalable-linear-solvers-multigrid-methods} .

SUNDIALS has been tested with hypre version 2.11.1.  To enable
\emph{hypre}, set \code{HYPRE\_ENABLE} to \code{ON}, set \code{HYPRE\_INCLUDE\_DIR} to
the \code{include} path of the \emph{hypre} installation, and set the variable
\code{HYPRE\_LIBRARY\_DIR} to the \code{lib} path of the \emph{hypre} installation.


\subsection{Building and Running Examples}
\label{Install:building-and-running-examples}\label{Install:installation-cmake-buildrunexamples}
Each of the SUNDIALS solvers is distributed with a set of examples
demonstrating basic usage.  To build and install the examples, set
both \code{EXAMPLES\_ENABLE} and \code{EXAMPLES\_INSTALL} to \code{ON}. Specify
the installation path for the examples with the variable
\code{EXAMPLES\_INSTALL\_PATH}. CMake will generate \code{CMakeLists.txt}
configuration files (and \code{Makefile} files if on Linux/Unix) that
reference the \emph{installed} SUNDIALS headers and libraries.

Either the \code{CMakeLists.txt} file or the traditional \code{Makefile} may
be used to build the examples as well as serve as a template for
creating user developed solutions.  To use the supplied \code{Makefile}
simply run \code{make} to compile and generate the executables.  To use
CMake from within the installed example directory, run \code{cmake} (or
\code{ccmake} or \code{cmake-gui} to use the GUI) followed by \code{make} to
compile the example code.  Note that if CMake is used, it will
overwrite the traditional \code{Makefile} with a new CMake-generated
\code{Makefile}.

The resulting output from running the examples can be compared with
example output bundled in the SUNDIALS distribution.

NOTE: There will potentially be differences in the output due to
machine architecture, compiler versions, use of third party libraries etc.


\subsection{Configuring, building, and installing on Windows}
\label{Install:installation-cmake-windows}\label{Install:configuring-building-and-installing-on-windows}
CMake can also be used to build SUNDIALS on Windows. To build SUNDIALS
for use with Visual Studio the following steps should be performed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Unzip the downloaded tar file(s) into a directory. This will be the
\code{SRCDIR}

\item {} 
Create a separate \code{BUILDDIR}

\item {} 
Open a Visual Studio Command Prompt and cd to \code{BUILDDIR}

\item {} 
Run \code{cmake-gui ../SRCDIR}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Hit Configure

\item {} 
Check/Uncheck solvers to be built

\item {} 
Change \code{CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX} to \code{INSTDIR}

\item {} 
Set other options as desired

\item {} 
Hit Generate

\end{enumerate}

\item {} 
Back in the VS Command Window:
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Run \code{msbuild ALL\_BUILD.vcxproj}

\item {} 
Run \code{msbuild INSTALL.vcxproj}

\end{enumerate}

\end{enumerate}

The resulting libraries will be in the \code{INSTDIR}.

The SUNDIALS project can also now be opened in Visual Studio.
Double click on the \code{ALL\_BUILD.vcxproj} file to open the project.
Build the whole \emph{solution} to create the SUNDIALS libraries.
To use the SUNDIALS libraries in your own projects, you must
set the include directories for your project,
add the SUNDIALS libraries to your project solution,
and set the SUNDIALS libraries as dependencies for your project.


\section{Installed libraries and exported header files}
\label{Install:installation-results}\label{Install:installed-libraries-and-exported-header-files}
Using the CMake SUNDIALS build system, the command

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
\PYGZdl{} make install
\end{Verbatim}

will install the libraries under \code{LIBDIR} and the public header
files under \code{INCLUDEDIR}. The values for these directories
are \code{INSTDIR/lib} and \code{INSTDIR/include}, respectively.  The
location can be changed by setting the CMake variable
\code{CMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX}.  Although all installed libraries reside
under \code{LIBDIR/lib}, the public header files are further organized
into subdirectories under \code{INCLUDEDIR/include}.

The installed libraries and exported header files are listed for
reference in the {\hyperref[Install:installation-table]{\emph{\DUspan{}{Table: SUNDIALS libraries and header files}}}}. The file extension \code{.LIB} is typically \code{.so}
for shared libraries and \code{.a} for static libraries. Note that, in
this table names are relative to \code{LIBDIR} for libraries and to
\code{INCLUDEDIR} for header files.

A typical user program need not explicitly include any of the shared
SUNDIALS header files from under the \code{INCLUDEDIR/include/sundials}
directory since they are explicitly included by the appropriate solver
header files (e.g., \code{cvode\_dense.h} includes
\code{sundials\_dense.h}). However, it is both legal and safe to do so,
and would be useful, for example, if the functions declared in
\code{sundials\_dense.h} are to be used in building a preconditioner.

\chapter{Appendix: Butcher tables}
\label{Butcher::doc}\label{Butcher:appendix-butcher-tables}\label{Butcher:butcher}
Here we catalog the full set of Butcher tables included in ARKode.
We group these into three categories: \emph{explicit}, \emph{implicit} and
\emph{additive}.  However, since the methods that comprise an additive
Runge Kutta method are themselves explicit and implicit, their
component Butcher tables are listed within their separate
sections, but are referenced together in the additive section.

In each of the following tables, we use the following notation (shown
for a 3-stage method):
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}\begin{array}{r|ccc}
  c_1 & a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & a_{1,3} \\
  c_2 & a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & a_{2,3} \\
  c_3 & a_{3,1} & a_{3,2} & a_{3,3} \\
  \hline
  q & b_1 & b_2 & b_3 \\
  p & \tilde{b}_1 & \tilde{b}_2 & \tilde{b}_3
\end{array}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where here the method and embedding share stage \(A\) and
\(c\) values, but use their stages \(z_i\) differently through
the coefficients \(b\) and \(\tilde{b}\) to generate methods
of orders \(q\) (the main method) and \(p\) (the embedding,
typically \(q = p+1\), though sometimes this is reversed).

Method authors often use different naming conventions to categorize
their methods.  For each of the methods below, we follow a uniform
naming convention:

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
NAME\PYGZhy{}S\PYGZhy{}P\PYGZhy{}Q
\end{Verbatim}

where here
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
\code{NAME} is the author or the name provided by the author (if applicable),

\item {} 
\code{S} is the number of stages in the method,

\item {} 
\code{P} is the global order of accuracy for the embedding,

\item {} 
\code{Q} is the global order of accuracy for the method.

\end{itemize}

In the code, unique integer IDs are defined inside \code{arkode.h} for
each method, which may be used by calling routines to specify the
desired method.  These names are specified in \code{fixed width font} at
the start of each method's section below.

Additionally, for each method we provide a plot of the linear
stability region in the complex plane.  These have been computed via
the following approach.  For any Runge Kutta method as defined above,
we may define the stability function
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}R(\eta) = 1 + \eta b [I - \eta A]^{-1} e,\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
where \(e\in\mathbb{R}^s\) is a column vector of all ones, \(\eta =
h\lambda\) and \(h\) is the time step size.  If the stability
function satisfies \(|R(\eta)| \le 1\) for all eigenvalues,
\(\lambda\), of \(\frac{\partial }{\partial y}f(t,y)\) for a
given IVP, then the method will be linearly stable for that problem
and step size.  The stability region
\begin{gather}
\begin{split}S = \{ \eta\in\mathbb{C}\; :\; \left| R(\eta) \right| \le 1\}\end{split}\notag
\end{gather}
is typically given by an enclosed region of the complex plane, so it
is standard to search for the border of that region in order to
understand the method.  Since all complex numbers with unit magnitude
may be written as \(e^{i\theta}\) for some value of \(\theta\),
we perform the following algorithm to trace out this boundary.
\begin{enumerate}
\item {} 
Define an array of values \code{Theta}.  Since we wish for a
smooth curve, and since we wish to trace out the entire boundary,
we choose 10,000 linearly-spaced points from 0 to \(16\pi\).
Since some angles will correspond to multiple locations on the
stability boundary, by going beyond \(2\pi\) we ensure that all
boundary locations are plotted, and by using such a fine
discretization the Newton method (next step) is more likely to
converge to the root closest to the previous boundary point,
ensuring a smooth plot.

\item {} 
For each value \(\theta \in\) \code{Theta}, we solve the nonlinear

\end{gather}
using a finite-difference Newton iteration, using tolerance
\(10^{-7}\), and differencing parameter
\(\sqrt{\varepsilon}\) (\(\approx 10^{-8}\)).

In this iteration, we use as initial guess the solution from the
previous value of \(\theta\), starting with an initial-initial
guess of \(\eta=0\) for \(\theta=0\).

\item {} 
We then plot the resulting \(\eta\) values that trace the
stability region boundary.

\end{enumerate}

We note that for any stable IVP method, the value \(\eta_0 =
-\varepsilon + 0i\) is always within the stability region.  So in each
of the following pictures, the interior of the stability region is the
connected region that includes \(\eta_0\).  Resultingly, methods
whose linear stability boundary is located entirely in the right
half-plane indicate an \emph{A-stable} method.
