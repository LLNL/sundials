# Benchmark: 2D Diffusion

This benchmark problem implements a 2D diffusion equation using either MPI,
MPI + CUDA, or MPI + HIP parallelism. Note a GPU-aware MPI implementation is
required.

## Problem description

This code simulates the anisotropic 2D heat equation,

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = k_x \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + k_y \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + b,$$

where $k_x$ and $k_y$ are the diffusion coefficients. The system is evolved for
$t$ in $[0, t_f]$ and $(x,y) = X$ in $[0, X_{max}]^2$ with the initial condition

$$u(0,X) = \sin^2(\pi x) \sin^2(\pi y),$$

and stationary boundary conditions

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(t,0,y) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(t,x_{max},y) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(t,x,0) = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(t,x,y_{max}) = 0.$$

The source term is given by

$$b(t,X) = -2 \pi \sin^2(\pi x) \sin^2(\pi y) \sin(\pi t) \cos(\pi t) - k_x 2 \pi^2 (\cos^2(\pi x) - \sin^2(\pi x)) \sin^2(\pi y) \cos^2(\pi t) - k_y 2 \pi^2 (\cos^2(\pi y) - \sin^2(\pi y)) \sin^2(\pi x) \cos^2(\pi t).$$

Under this setup, the problem has the analytical solution

$$u(t,X) = \sin^2(\pi x) \sin^2(\pi y) \cos^2(\pi t).$$

Spatial derivatives are computed using second-order centered differences on a
uniform spatial grid. The problem can be evolved in time with ARKODE, CVODE, or
IDA. With ARKODE, an adaptive step diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) method
is applied. When using CVODE or IDA, adaptive order and step BDF methods are
used.

In all cases, the nonlinear system(s) in each time step are solved using an
inexact Newton method paired with a matrix-free PCG or GMRES linear solver and a
Jacobi preconditioner. If SUNDIALS is built with the SuperLU_DIST interface enabled
a modified Newton method with SuperLU_DIST as the direct linear solver may also be
selected at run time.

## Building

To build the benchmark executables SUNDIALS should be configured with ARKODE,
CVODE, or IDA enabled, MPI support turned on, and benchmarks enabled. If
SUNDIALS is configured with SuperLU_DIST enabled this linear solver can be
selected at run time and may utilizie OpenMP, CUDA, or ROCM (HIP) for on-node
parallelism. If SUNDIALS is configured with CUDA or HIP support enabled
additional executables utilizing CUDA and HIP will be built. See the SUNDIALS
installation guide for more details on configuring, building, and installing.

## Running

Based on the configuration, executables for each integrator and backend option
are built and installed in `<BENCHMARKS_INSTALL_PATH>/diffusion_2D`. The
executables follow the naming convention `<package>_diffusion_2D_<parallelism>`
where `<package>` is `arkode`, `cvode`, or `ida` and `<parallelism>` is `mpi` for
MPI only parallelism, `mpicuda` for MPI + CUDA, and `mpihip` for MPI + HIP. Note
when using the SuperLU_DIST linear solver computations will be offloaded to the
GPU in the MPI only executables if CUDA or ROCM support is enabled in SuperLU_DIST.
