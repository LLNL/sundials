The {\spgmr} package, in the files \id{sundials\_spgmr.h} and \id{sundials\_spgmr.c}, includes an
implementation of the scaled preconditioned GMRES\index{GMRES method} method.  
A separate code module, implemented in \id{sundials\_iterative.(h,c)}, contains auxiliary
functions that support {\spgmr}, as well as the other Krylov solvers in {\sundials}
({\spbcg} and {\sptfqmr}).
For full details, including usage instructions, see the header
files \id{sundials\_spgmr.h} and \id{sundials\_iterative.h}.

Relative to the {\sundials} {\em source\_tree}, the files comprising the
{\spgmr} generic linear solver are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item header files (located in {\em source\_tree}\id{/shared/include})\\
  \id{sundials\_spgmr.h} \id{sundials\_iterative.h} \id{sundials\_nvector.h} \\
  \id{sundials\_types.h} \id{sundials\_math.h}  \id{sundials\_config.h}
\item source files (located in {\em source\_tree}\id{/shared/source})\\
  \id{sundials\_spgmr.c} \id{sundials\_iterative.c} \id{sundials\_nvector.c}
\end{itemize}
Only two of the preprocessing directives in the header file \id{sundials\_config.h} 
are required to use the {\spgmr} package by itself (see \S\ref{ss:no_config} for details):
\begin{itemize}
\item (required) definition of the precision of the {\sundials} type \id{realtype}. 
  One of the following lines must be present:\\
  \id{\#define SUNDIALS\_DOUBLE\_PRECISION 1}\\
  \id{\#define SUNDIALS\_SINGLE\_PRECISION 1}\\
  \id{\#define SUNDIALS\_EXTENDED\_PRECISION 1}
\item (optional) use of generic math functions:\\
  \id{\#define SUNDIALS\_USE\_GENERIC\_MATH 1}
\end{itemize}
The \id{sundials\_types.h} header file defines the {\sundials}
\id{realtype} and \id{booleantype} types and the macro \id{RCONST}, while the 
\id{sundials\_math.h} header file is needed for the \id{MAX} and \id{ABS} macros 
and \id{RAbs} and \id{RSqrt} functions.

The generic {\nvector} files, \id{sundials\_nvector.(h,c)} are needed for the
definition of the generic \id{N\_Vector} type and functions. 
The {\nvector} functions used by the {\spgmr} module are: 
\id{N\_VDotProd}, \id{N\_VLinearSum}, \id{N\_VScale}, \id{N\_VProd}, \id{N\_VDiv}, 
\id{N\_VConst}, \id{N\_VClone}, \id{N\_VCloneVectorArray}, \id{N\_VDestroy}, and
\id{N\_VDestroyVectorArray}.

{\warn}The {\spgmr} package can only be used in conjunction with an actual {\nvector} 
implementation library, such as the {\nvecs} or {\nvecp} provided with {\sundials}.

The nine files listed above can be extracted from the {\sundials} {\em source\_tree} and
compiled by themselves into an {\spgmr} library or into a larger user code.
