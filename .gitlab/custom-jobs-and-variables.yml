# We define the following GitLab pipeline variables:
variables:
# In some pipelines we create only one allocation shared among jobs in
# order to save time and resources. This allocation has to be uniquely
# named so that we are sure to retrieve it and avoid collisions.
  ALLOC_NAME: ${CI_PROJECT_NAME}_ci_${CI_PIPELINE_ID}

# Dane
# Arguments for top level allocation
  DANE_SHARED_ALLOC: "--exclusive --reservation=ci --time=60 --nodes=1"
# Arguments for job level allocation
  DANE_JOB_ALLOC: "--time=55 --nodes=1 --overlap"
# Add variables that should apply to all the jobs on a machine:
#  DANE_MY_VAR: "..."

# Tioga
# Arguments for top level allocation
  TIOGA_SHARED_ALLOC: "--exclusive --queue pci --time-limit=60m --nodes=1"
# Arguments for job level allocation
  TIOGA_JOB_ALLOC: "--time-limit=55m --nodes=1"

#  TIOGA_MY_VAR: "..."

# Number of threads to use for builds.
  BUILD_JOBS: 32

# Sets CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE to TRUE when "ON".
  VERBOSE_BUILD: "ON"

# Passes --verbose to CTest when "ON".
  VERBOSE_TEST: "ON"

# Should the Dane pipeline run? Set to  "ON" or "OFF" to enable/disable.
  ON_DANE: "ON"

# Should the Tioga pipeline run? Set to "ON" or "OFF" to enable/disable.
  ON_TIOGA: "ON"

# If "ON", then the SUNDIALS benchmark problems are run and generate profiles.

# Number of nodes to use for benchmarks. Default is 4.

# What queue to submit the benchmarks too. Default is pbatch (for Livermore).

# Configuration shared by build and test jobs specific to this project.
# Not all configuration can be shared. Here projects can fine tune the

# See Umpire for an example (export junit test reports).
