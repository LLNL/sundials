Modifications to SUNDIALS after 22 March 2012 Release - as of 1 May 2013

Note: Some of these modifications are actually accessible by the
public by way of updates to the website after 3/22/12.


1. In top level README file, changed release date from January to March 2012.

2. In top level file Makefile.in, changed top_builddir = @top_builddir@
   to top_builddir = @builddir@ to correct installation failures.

3. Updated top-level file configure.ac with new version number.

4.(a) Added file /sundialsTB/doc/html_files/stb_template/graph.tpl
      from Radu's template directory.
  (b) Added directory /sundialsTB/doc/tex_files/stb_template, and added to it
      files graph.tpl, m2tex.tex, master.tpl, mdir.tpl, mfile.tpl, todo.tpl
      (from Radu's directory), for use in making sundialsTB.ps.
  (c) Added file /sundialsTB/doc/README_texdoc, with instructions on using m2html
      and supplied templates to generate sundialsTB.ps.
  (d) Added file /doc/texi2dvi, as it no longer seems to be in the casc
      LaTex install.

5. In each file /doc/<solver>/Makefile, commented out lines generating
   html files, and cp of .ps files to html/.

6. Files /html/main.html, /html/documentation/documentation.html,
   /html/download/download.html, /html/support/support.html modified
   by Laura Schulz for 3/22/12 release.

7. File /html/download/whatsnew.html modified by ACH for 3/22/12 release.

8. In file /html/support/notes.html, changed 3 example names, removed
   links to html sources, corrected related text.

9. In files cvode.c, cvodes.c, ida.c, idas.c, corrected minor bug in
   **Rootfind, where input rootdir was ignored. (From bug report by T. Bourke.)

10.(a) In files /src/cvode/fcmix/{fcvbp.h, fcvbbd.h} removed/corrected
       lines mentioning obsolete names FCVBPSP*** and FCVBBDSP**.
   (b) In file /src/ida/fcmix/fidabbd.h, femoved comment lines mentioning
       obsolete names FIDABBDSP***.
   (c) In file /doc/ida/ida_fcmix.tex, removed/corrected lines
       mentioning obsolete names FIDABBDSP***.

11. In file cvodes.c, corrected line in CVodeQuadSensInit:
    cv_mem->cv_fQS_data = ... (missing Q).

12. In CVODES example cvsHessian_ASA_FSA.c, and output cvsHessian_ASA_FSA.out,
    corrected error (y3 -> y2) in fB2, 3rd term of Ith(yBdot,6).  (From bug
    report by N. Singer.)

13. In KINSOL file kinsol_direct.c, function kinDlsBandDQJac, change
    ABS(uscale_data[j])  to   ONE/ABS(uscale_data[j]) in 2 places setting inc.

14. In doc file install.tex, (a) swapped A.1 (autotools) and A.2 (CMake);
    (b) corrected warning about single prec. use: 32-bit systems.

15. In 5 files ***_lapack.c, changed smu = MIN(N-1,mu+ml) to smu = mu+ml
    to correct illegal input error for DGBTRF/DGBTRS.

16. In KINSOL, function KINStop, corrected two return values to make
    u = uu and F = fval values consistent.

17. In CVODES and IDAS User Guides, Section 6.2.1,added paragraphs on
    CVodeAdjReInit and IDAAdjReInit, respectively.

18. (a) In CVODES and IDAS User Guides, Section 6.2.9,added paragraphs on
    CVodeGetAdjY and IDAGetAdjY resp.
    (b) In CVODES example cvsRoberts_ASAi_dns, revised output to include
    use of CVodeGetAdjY. In CVODES Examples document, revised Sec. 3.1 to
    describe new output.

19. In CVODES, added an option in the ASA case with dense or banded Jacobian:
    With a call to CVDlsSetDenseJacFnBS or CVDlsSetBandJacFnBS, the user
    can specify a user-supplied Jacobian function of type CVDls***JacFnBS,
    for the case where the backward problem depends on the forward
    sensitivities.

20. In each doc/***, fixed bug in Makefile: in each shared-file list, moved
    commented lines to bottom of list.  (Fixes item 5 above.)

21. Added option in IDAS corresponding to CVODES addition above:
    In IDAS, added an option in the ASA case with dense or banded Jacobian:
    With a call to IDADlsSetDenseJacFnBS or IDADlsSetBandJacFnBS, the user
    can specify a user-supplied Jacobian function of type IDADls***JacFnBS,
    for the case where the backward problem depends on the forward
    sensitivities.

22. After discussion with Dan R., changed optional input routines in FKINSOL,
    FCVODE, and FIDA:  Removed 4th argument (key_length) from **SET*IN functions,
    and hardcoded key string lengths into all strncmp tests.  Corrected bug
    (missing line *ier = 0) in FKINSET_VIN.

23. In CVODE/CVODES/IDA/IDAS function **Rootfind, added line to break out
    of root-search loop if initial interval size is below tolerance ttol.
    In KINSOL User Guide, added missing description of FKINSETVIN.

24. In CVODE/CVODES/IDA/IDAS main source file, made cosmetic changes in
    rootfinder functions to minimize differences across the solver suite.

25. In CVODE/IDA/IDAS main source file, made fix to **ProcessError function
    as given by Radu 1/31/13: vsprintf call moved to top, msg arg. in fprintf.
    Cosmetic changes and typo fixes made to these and CVODES file cvodes.c.

26. In response to a complaint from Joel Andersson (12/4/12), changed misleading
    names yB0, ypB0, etc. in IDAS User Guide for IDACalcICB & IDACalcICBS.
    Also fixed incorrect or poorly worded argument descriptions for y, yp, etc.
    throughout IDAS and CVODES User Guides (ASA chapter).

27. On seeing that many CVODE and CVODES private functions that should be
    identical are not, made changes to correct this: Changed 48 CVODE private
    function names from CV** to cv**.  Made numerous minor cosmetic changes
    in cvode.c  and cvodes.c to make private functions match as much as
    possible.  Fixed minor comment errors in cvode.c, cvodes.c, cvodes_impl.h.
    In cvodes.c, corrected the name passed to cvProcessError by cvInitialSetup
    (was CVode).
