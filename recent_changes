Note: Some of these modifications are actually accessible by the
public by way of updates to the website after 3/22/12.


1. In top level README file, changed release date from January to March 2012.

2. In top level file Makefile.in, changed top_builddir = @top_builddir@
   to top_builddir = @builddir@ to correct installation failures.

3. Updated top-level file configure.ac with new version number.

4.(a) Added file /sundialsTB/doc/html_files/stb_template/graph.tpl
      from Radu's template directory.
  (b) Added directory /sundialsTB/doc/tex_files/stb_template, and added to it
      files graph.tpl, m2tex.tex, master.tpl, mdir.tpl, mfile.tpl, todo.tpl
      (from Radu's directory), for use in making sundialsTB.ps.
  (c) Added file /sundialsTB/doc/README_texdoc, with instructions on using m2html
      and supplied templates to generate sundialsTB.ps.
  (d) Added file /doc/texi2dvi, as it no longer seems to be in the casc
      LaTex install.

5. In each file /doc/<solver>/Makefile, commented out lines generating
   html files, and cp of .ps files to html/.

6. Files /html/main.html, /html/documentation/documentation.html,

8. In file /html/support/notes.html, changed 3 example names, removed
   links to html sources, corrected related text.

9. In files cvode.c, cvodes.c, ida.c, idas.c, corrected minor bug in
   **Rootfind, where input rootdir was ignored. (From bug report by T. Bourke.)

10.(a) In files /src/cvode/fcmix/{fcvbp.h, fcvbbd.h} removed/corrected
       lines mentioning obsolete names FCVBPSP*** and FCVBBDSP**.

12. In CVODES example cvsHessian_ASA_FSA.c, and output cvsHessian_ASA_FSA.out,
    corrected error (y3 -> y2) in fB2, 3rd term of Ith(yBdot,6).  (From bug
    report by N. Singer.)

13. In KINSOL file kinsol_direct.c, function kinDlsBandDQJac, change
    ABS(uscale_data[j])  to   ONE/ABS(uscale_data[j]) in 2 places setting inc.

14. In doc file install.tex, (a) swapped A.1 (autotools) and A.2 (CMake);
    (b) corrected warning about single prec. use: 32-bit systems.

15. In 5 files ***_lapack.c, changed smu = MIN(N-1,mu+ml) to smu = mu+ml
    to correct illegal input error for DGBTRF/DGBTRS.

16. In KINSOL, function KINStop, corrected two return values to make
    u = uu and F = fval values consistent.

17. In CVODES and IDAS User Guides, Section 6.2.1,added paragraphs on
    CVodeAdjReInit and IDAAdjReInit, respectively.

18. (a) In CVODES and IDAS User Guides, Section 6.2.9,added paragraphs on
    CVodeGetAdjY and IDAGetAdjY resp.
    (b) In CVODES example cvsRoberts_ASAi_dns, revised output to include
    use of CVodeGetAdjY. In CVODES Examples document, revised Sec. 3.1 to
    describe new output.

19. In CVODES, added an option in the ASA case with dense or banded Jacobian:
    With a call to CVDlsSetDenseJacFnBS or CVDlsSetBandJacFnBS, the user
    can specify a user-supplied Jacobian function of type CVDls***JacFnBS,
    for the case where the backward problem depends on the forward
    sensitivities.

20. In each doc/***, fixed bug in Makefile: in each shared-file list, moved
    commented lines to bottom of list.  (Fixes item 5 above.)

21. Added option in IDAS corresponding to CVODES addition above:
    In IDAS, added an option in the ASA case with dense or banded Jacobian:
    With a call to IDADlsSetDenseJacFnBS or IDADlsSetBandJacFnBS, the user
    can specify a user-supplied Jacobian function of type IDADls***JacFnBS,
    for the case where the backward problem depends on the forward
    sensitivities.

22. After discussion with Dan R., changed optional input routines in FKINSOL,
    FCVODE, and FIDA:  Removed 4th argument (key_length) from **SET*IN functions,
    and hardcoded key string lengths into all strncmp tests.  Corrected bug
    (missing line *ier = 0) in FKINSET_VIN.

23. In CVODE/CVODES/IDA/IDAS function **Rootfind, added line to break out
    of root-search loop if initial interval size is below tolerance ttol.
    In KINSOL User Guide, added missing description of FKINSETVIN.

24. In CVODE/CVODES/IDA/IDAS main source file, made cosmetic changes in
    rootfinder functions to minimize differences across the solver suite.

25. In CVODE/IDA/IDAS main source file, made fix to **ProcessError function
    as given by Radu 1/31/13: vsprintf call moved to top, msg arg. in fprintf.
    Cosmetic changes and typo fixes made to these and CVODES file cvodes.c.

26. In response to a complaint from Joel Andersson (12/4/12), changed misleading
    names yB0, ypB0, etc. in IDAS User Guide for IDACalcICB & IDACalcICBS.
    Also fixed incorrect or poorly worded argument descriptions for y, yp, etc.
    throughout IDAS and CVODES User Guides (ASA chapter).

27. On seeing that many CVODE and CVODES private functions that should be
    identical are not, made changes to correct this: Changed 48 CVODE private
    function names from CV** to cv**.  Made numerous minor cosmetic changes
    in cvode.c  and cvodes.c to make private functions match as much as
    possible.  Fixed minor comment errors in cvode.c, cvodes.c, cvodes_impl.h.
    In cvodes.c, corrected the name passed to cvProcessError by cvInitialSetup
    (was CVode).

28. Fixed minor errors (all in comments) reported by S. Ledru 3/18/13, in
    cvDiurnal_kry_p.c, cvsDiurnal_kry_p.c, cvode_bandpre.h, cvode_bbdpre.h,
    cvode.c, cvodes_bandpre.h, cvodes_bbdpre.h, ida.h, ida_bbdpre.h, ida_direct.h,
    ida.c, idas_direct.h.

29. In FKINSOL module, fixed return value (= ier) in FKINfunc (file fkinsol.c),
    and fixed corresponding description of FKFUN in fkinsol.h.  Also changed
    void to int in "typedef void (*KINSysFn)..." in User Guide (file kin_use.tex).
    In examples fkinDiagon_kry.f and fkinDiagon_kry_p.,f, changed format specs i2
    to i4 in writes of error return values.

30. Fixed bug in KINSOL involving initialization of mxnewtstep.  On repeated
    user calls to KINSol with no call to KINSetMaxNewtonStep, the old value of
    mxnewtstep was being incorrectly used.  In the fix, a new solver memory
    member, mxnstepin, is the input (or preset to 0) value of mxnewtstep.
    KINSetMaxNewtonStep sets mxnstepin (if non-negative).  KINSolInit sets
    mxnewtstep to either the default or user's input according to mxnstepin.

31. In all FCVODE, FIDA, FKINSOL examples, revised integer declarations so that
    those which must match a C type (long int or int) have INTEGER*4 and a
    comment about the type match.  All others are just INTEGER.  In the
    corresponding user guides, added (or corrected) notes about the type
    of N and Nlocal, and of arguments to FCVBPOPT and *BBDOPT.

32. Added ARKODE solver to SUNDIALS, including additional PCG and FGMRES 
    Krylov solvers and CMAKE-based build system support for C++ and Fortran90
    example programs.  Also added a new parallel N_Vector kernel, corresponding 
    to a multi-dimensional Cartesian grid with an arbitrary number of ghost zones
    defined at each Cartesian face.

33. Updated all copyright notices to reflect LLNS instead of UC and added
    ausipices.

34. Updated LICENSE files with LLNS information.

35. Removed all C++-style "//" comments to enforce ANSI C standards.

36. Added KLU as a serial sparse-direct solver option to IDAS and KINSOL.

37. Added SuperLU_MT (the multi-threaded version of SuperLU) as a thread-
    parallel sparse direct solver option to IDAS.

38. Added fixed point and Picard iteratinos both with Anderson acceleration
    to KINSOL.

39. Added sparse matrix (CSC format) structure to IDAS and KINSOL.

40. Added openMP and pThreads vector kernels.

41. Added test code for vector kernel routines.

42. Corrected error in cvDiurnal_kry_bp.c with added CVBandPrecInit call.

43. Corrected typo in prototype for CVSpilsSetEpsLinB

44. Fixed bug in CVODES: initialization of nefQS to 0.

45. Removed argument m (= n) from CVSuperLUMT(), CVSuperLUMTB(), IDASuperLUMT(),
    IDASuperLUMTB(), KINSuperLUMT(), in solvers and examples.

46. Corrected name IDASetAdjNoSensi --> IDAAdjSetNoSensi.

47. In IDA/IDAS, fixed test for valid N_Vector module in InitialSetup with
    suppressalg on.

48. Added missing tstop argument in *SetStopTime (4 solvers).

49. Corrected legality test of tstop on first call (4 solvers).

50. Corrected error in cvsAtmDisp_ASAi_kry_bbd_p.c (#define L).

51. Corrected bug in IDASpilsSetJacTimesVecFnB() in idas_spils.c (memory arg.).

52. Added options in CVODES for the user's pset, psolve, jtv functions for
    the backward problem to depend on the forward sensitivities.

53. Added options in IDAS for the user's pset, psolve, jtv functions for
    the backward problem to depend on the forward sensitivities.

54. Changed macro names MIN, MAX, ABS, SQR, SQRT, EXP to SUNMIN, etc.

55. In CVODE/CVODES, fixed bug by adding line to set *tret on first call.

56. Added new example, cvAdvDiff_diag_p.
