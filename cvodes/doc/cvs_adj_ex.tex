\section{Adjoint sensitivity analysis example problems}\label{s:adj_examples}
%===================================================================================

The next three sections describe in detail a serial example (\id{cvadx}) and
two parallel examples (\id{pvanx} and \id{pvakx}). For details on the other
examples, the reader is directed to the comments in their source files.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{A serial dense example: \id{cvadx}}\label{ss:cvadx}

As a first example of using {\cvodes} for adjoint sensitivity analysis
we examine the chemical kinetics problem (from \id{cvfdx}) 
\begin{equation}\label{e:cvadx_ODE}
  \begin{split}
    &{\dot y}_1 = -p_1 y_1 + p_2 y_2 y_3   \\
    &{\dot y}_2 =  p_1 y_1 - p_2 y_2 y_3 - p_3 y_2^2 \\
    &{\dot y}_3 =  p_3 y_2^2 \\
    &y(t_0) = y_0 \, ,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
for which we want to compute the gradient with respect to $p$ of 
\begin{equation}\label{e:cvadx_G}
  G(p) = \int_{t_0}^{t_1}  y_3  dt ,
\end{equation}
without having to compute the solution sensitivities ${dy}/{dp}$.
Following the derivation in \ugref{ss:adj_sensi}, and taking into account
the fact that the initial values of (\ref{e:cvadx_ODE}) do not depend on 
the parameters $p$, by (\ref{e:dGdp}) this gradient is simply
\begin{equation}\label{e:cvadx_dGdp}
\frac{dG}{dp} = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} 
\left( g_p + \lambda^T f_p \right) dt \, ,
\end{equation}
where $g(t,y,p) = y_3$, $f$ is the vector-valued function 
defining the right-hand side of (\ref{e:cvadx_ODE}), and $\lambda$ is 
the solution of the adjoint problem (\ref{e:adj_eqns}),
\begin{equation}\label{e:cvadx_ADJ}
  \begin{split}
    &{\dot\lambda} = - (f_y)^T  \lambda - (g_y)^T \\
    &\lambda(t_1) = 0 \, .
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

In order to avoid saving intermediate $\lambda$ values just for the
evaluation of the integral in (\ref{e:cvadx_dGdp}), we extend the
backward problem with the following $N_p$ quadrature equations
\begin{equation}\label{e:cvadx_XI}
  \begin{split}
    &{\dot\xi} = g_p^T + f_p^T \lambda \\
    &\xi (t_1) = 0 \, ,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
which yield $\xi(t_0) = - \int_{t_0}^{t_1} ( g_p^T + f_p^T \lambda) dt$
and thus ${dG}/{dp} = -\xi^T(t_0)$.
Similarly, the value of $G$ in (\ref{e:cvadx_G}) can be obtained as
$G = - \zeta(t_0)$, where $\zeta$ is solution of the following quadrature
equation:
\begin{equation}\label{e:cvadx_ZETA}
  \begin{split}
    &{\dot\zeta} = g \\
    &\zeta(t_1) = 0 \, .
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

The source code for this example is listed in \A\ref{s:cvadx_c}.
The main program and the user-defined routines are described below, 
with emphasis on the aspects particular to adjoint sensitivity calculations.

The calling program includes the {\cvodes} header files \id{cvodes.h} 
and \id{cvodea.h} for {\cvodes} definitions and interface function prototypes,
the header file \id{cvdense.h} for the {\cvdense} linear solver module,
the header file \id{nvector\_serial.h} for the definition of the serial implementation
of the {\nvector} module - {\nvecs}, and the file \id{sundialsmath.h} for the
definition of the \id{ABS} macro.
%% 
This program also includes two user-defined accessor macros,
\id{Ith} and \id{IJth}
that are useful in writing the problem functions in a form closely
matching their mathematical description, i.e. with components numbered from 1 instead of from 0. 
Following that, the program defines problem-specific constants and a user-defined 
data structure which will be used to pass the values of the parameters $p$ to various
user routines. The constant \id{STEPS} defines the number of integration steps
between two consecutive checkpoints.
The program prologue ends with the prototypes of four user-supplied functions that are
called by {\cvodes}. The first two provide the right-hand side and dense Jacobian
for the forward problem, and the last two provide the right-hand side and dense Jacobian 
for the backward problem.

The \id{main} function begins with type declarations and continues with the
allocation and initialization of the user data structure which contains the values 
of the parameters $p$. Next, it allocates and
initializes \id{y} with the initial conditions for the forward problem, allocates and 
initializes \id{q} for the quadrature used in computing the value $G$, and finally
sets the scalar relative tolerance \id{reltolQ} and vector absolute tolerance \id{abstolQ}
for the quadrature variable. No tolerances for the state variables are defined since
\id{cvadx} uses its own function to compute the error weights for WRMS norm
estimates of state solution vectors.

The call to \id{CVodeCreate} creates the main integrator memory block for the 
forward integration and specifies the \id{CV\_BDF} integration method with 
\id{CV\_NEWTON} iteration. 
The call to \id{CVodeMalloc} initializes the forward integration by specifying the 
initial conditions and that a function for error weights will be provided (\id{itol=CV\_WF}. 
The next two calls specify the optional user data pointer and error weight calculation
function.
The linear solver is selected to be {\cvdense} through the call to its 
initialization routine \id{CVDense}. The user provided Jacobian routine \id{Jac}
and user data structure \id{data} are specified through a call to \id{CVDenseSetJacFn}.

The next code block initializes quadrature computations on the forward phase, by
specifying the user data structure to be passed to the function \id{fQ},
including the quadrature variable in the error test, and setting the integration tolerances
for the quadrature variable and finally allocating {\cvodes} memory for quadrature
integration (the call to \id{CVodeQuadMalloc} specifies the right-hand side
of the quadrature equation and the initial values of the quadrature variable).

Allocation for the memory block of the combined forward-backward problem is
acomplished through the call to \id{CVadjMalloc} which specifies \id{STEPS = 150},
the number of steps between two checkpoints.

The call to \id{CVodeF} requests the solution of the forward problem to \id{TOUT}.
If successful, at the end of the integration, \id{CVodeF} will return the number
of saved checkpoints in the argument \id{ncheck} (optionally, a list of the checkpoints
can be printed by calling \id{CVadjGetCheckPointsList}).

The next segment of code deals with the setup of the backward problem. 
First, a serial vector \id{yB} of length \id{NEQ} is allocated and initalized with the
value of $\lambda$ at the final time ($0.0$). 
A second serial vector \id{qB} of dimension \id{NP} is created and initialized to $0.0$.
This vector corresponds to the quadrature variables $\xi$ whose values at $t_0$ 
are the components of the gradient of $G$ with respect to the problem parameters $p$.
%%
Following that, the program sets the relative and absolute tolerances for the backward integration.

The {\cvodes} memory for the integration of the backward integration is created and allocated
by the calls to the interface routines \id{CVodeCreateB} amd \id{CVodeMallocB} which 
specify the \id{CV\_BDF} integration method with \id{CV\_NEWTON} iteration, among other things.
The dense linear solver {\cvdense} is then initialized by calling the \id{CVDenseB}
interface routine and specifying a non-\id{NULL} Jacobian routine \id{JacB} and user data
\id{data}.

The tolerances for the integration of quadrature variables, \id{reltolB} and
\id{abstolQB}, are specified through \id{CVodeSetQuadTolerancesB}.
The call to \id{CVodeSetQuadErrConB} indicates that $\xi$ should be included
in the error test.
Quadrature computation is initialized by calling \id{CVodeQuadMallocB}
which specifies the right-hand side of the quadrature equations as \id{fQB}.

The actual solution of the backward problem is acomplished through the call to
\id{CVodeB}. If successful, \id{CVodeB} returns the solution of the backward 
problem at time \id{T0} in the vector \id{yB}. The values of the quadrature
variables at time \id{T0} are loaded in \id{qB} by calling the extraction
routine \id{CVodeGetQuadB}. The values for $G$ and its gradient are printed next.

The main program continues with a call to \id{CVodeReInitB} and
\id{CVodeQuadReInitB} to re-initialize the 
backward memory block for a new adjoint computation with a different final 
time (\id{TB2}), followed by a second call to \id{CVodeB} and, upon successful
return, reporting of the new values for $G$ and its gradient.

The main program ends by freeing previously allocated memory by calling 
\id{CVodeFree} (for the {\cvodes} memory for the forward problem), \id{CVadjFree} 
(for the memory allocated for the combined problem), and \id{N\_VFree\_Serial} 
(for the various vectors).

The user-supplied functions \id{f} and \id{Jac} for the right-hand side and
Jacobian of the forward problem are straightforward expressions of its 
mathematical formulation (\ref{e:cvadx_ODE}). 
The function \id{ewt} is the same as the one for \id{cvdx.c}.
The function \id{fQ} implements
(\ref{e:cvadx_ZETA}), while \id{fB}, \id{JacB}, and \id{fQB} are mere translations 
of the backward problem (\ref{e:cvadx_ADJ}) and (\ref{e:cvadx_XI}).

The output generated by \id{cvadx} is shown below.

\subsection{A parallel nonstiff example: \id{pvanx}}
\label{ss:pvanx}

As an example of using the {\cvodes} adjoint sensitivity module with
the parallel vector module {\nvecp}, we describe a sample program
that solves the following problem: consider the 1-D advection-diffusion
equation
\begin{equation}\label{e:pvanx:orig_pde}
  \begin{split}
    & \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = p_1 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} 
    + p_2 \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \\
    & 0 = x_0 \le x \le x_1 = 2 \\
    & 0 = t_0 \le t \le t_1 = 2.5 \, ,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
with boundary conditions $u(t,x_0) = u(t,x_1) = 0 ,\, \forall t$,
and initial condition $u(t_0 , x) = u_0(x) = x(2-x)e^{2x}$. Also
consider the function
\begin{equation*}
  g(t) = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} u(t,x) dx \, .
\end{equation*}
We wish to find, through adjoint sensitivity analysis, the gradient of
$g(t_1)$ with respect to $p = [p_1 ; p_2]$ and the perturbation in $g(t_1)$
due to a perturbation $\delta u_0$ in $u_0$.

The approach we take in the program \id{pvanx} is to first derive an 
adjoint PDE which is then discretized in space and integrated backwards
in time to yield the desired sensitivities. A straightforward extension 
to PDEs of the derivation given in \ugref{ss:adj_sensi} gives
\begin{equation}\label{e:pvanx:dgdp}
  \frac{dg}{dp} (t_1) = \int_{t_0}^{t_1} dt 
  \int_{x_0}^{x_1} dx \mu \cdot 
  \left[
    \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} ;
    \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
  \right ]
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{e:pvanx:delg}
  \delta g |_{t_1} = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} \mu(t_0,x) \delta u_0(x) dx \, , 
\end{equation}
where $\mu$ is the solution of the adjoint PDE
\begin{equation}\label{e:pvanx:adj_pde}
  \begin{split}
    & \frac{\partial \mu}{\partial t} + p_1 \frac{\partial^2 \mu}{\partial x^2} 
    - p_2 \frac{\partial \mu}{\partial x} = 0 \\
    & \mu(t_1 , x) = 1 \\
    & \mu(t , x_0) = \mu( t , x_1 ) = 0 \, .
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Both the forward problem (\ref{e:pvanx:orig_pde}) and the backward problem 
(\ref{e:pvanx:adj_pde}) are discretized on a uniform spatial grid of size
$M_x + 2$ with central differencing and with boundary values eliminated,
leaving ODE systems of size $N = M_x$ each. 
As always, we deal with the time quadratures in (\ref{e:pvanx:dgdp}) by introducing
the additional equations
\begin{equation}\label{e:pvanx:quad}
  \begin{split}
    &{\dot\xi}_1 = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} dx \mu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \, , \quad
    \xi_1(t_1) = 0 \, , \\
    &{\dot\xi}_2 = \int_{x_0}^{x_1} dx \mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \, , \quad
    \xi_2(t_1) = 0 \, ,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
yielding
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{dg}{dp} (t_1) = \left[ \xi_1(t_0) ; \xi_2(t_0) \right ]
\end{equation*}
The space integrals in (\ref{e:pvanx:delg}) and (\ref{e:pvanx:quad}) are
evaluated numerically, on the given spatial mesh, using the trapezoidal rule.

Note that $\mu(t_0 , x^*)$ is nothing but the perturbation in $g(t_1)$
due to a perturbation $\delta u_0(x) = \delta(x-x^*)$ in the initial conditions.
Therefore, $\mu(t_0,x)$ completely describes $\delta g(t_1)$ for any
perturbation $\delta u_0$.

The source code for this example is listed in \A\ref{s:pvanx_c}. Both the forward
and the backward problems are solved with the option for nonstiff systems,
i.e. using the Adams method with functional iteration for the solution of
the nonlinear systems. The overall structure of the \id{main} function is very
similar to that of the code \id{cvadx} discussed previously with 
differences arising from the use of the parallel {\nvector} module. Unlike 
\id{cvadx}, the example \id{pvanx} illustrates computation of the additional
quadrature variables by appending \id{NP} equations to the adjoint system.
This approach can be a better alternative to using special treatment
of the quadrature equations when their number is too small for parallel 
treatment.

Besides the parallelism implemented by {\cvodes} at the {\nvector} level,
\id{pvanx} uses {\mpi} calls to parallelize the calculations of the right-hand side
routines \id{f} and \id{fB} and of the spatial integrals involved.
The forward problem has size \id{NEQ = MX}, while the backward problem has
size \id{NB = NEQ + NP}, where \id{NP = 2} is the number of quadrature equations
in (\ref{e:pvanx:quad}).
The use of the total number of available processes on two problems of different 
sizes deserves some comments, as this is typical in adjoint sensitivity 
analysis. Out of the total number of available processes, namely \id{nprocs},
the first \id{npes = nprocs - 1} processes are dedicated to the integration of
the ODEs arising from the semi-discretization of the PDEs 
(\ref{e:pvanx:orig_pde}) and (\ref{e:pvanx:adj_pde}) and receive
the same load on both the forward and backward integration phases. 
The last process is reserved for the integration of the quadrature equations 
(\ref{e:pvanx:quad}), and is therefore inactive during the forward phases.
Of course, for problems involving a much larger number of quadrature equations,
more than one process could be reserved for their integration. 
An alternative would be to redistribute the \id{NB} backward problem variables 
over all available processes, without any relationship to the load distribution 
of the forward phase. However, the approach taken in \id{pvanx} has the 
advantage that the communication strategy adopted for the forward problem 
can be directly transfered to communication among the first \id{npes}
processes during the backward integration phase. 

We must also emphasize that, although inactive during the forward integration phase, 
the last process {\em must} participate in that phase with a 
{\em zero local array length}. 
This is because, during the backward integration phase, this process must
have its own local copy of variables (such as \id{cvadj\_mem}) that were set
only during the forward phase.

Using \id{MX} $=40$ on 4 proceses, the gradient of $g(t_f)$ with respect to 
the two problem parameters is obtained as $dg/dp(t_f) = [ -1.13856; -1.01023]$.
The gradient of $g(t_f)$ with respect to the initial conditions is shown in
Fig.~\ref{f:pvanx}. The gradient is plotted superimposed over the initial conditions.

\subsection{An SPGMR parallel example using the CVBBDPRE module: \id{pvakx}}
\label{ss:pvakx}

As a more elaborated adjoint sensitivity parallel example we describe next
the \id{pvakx} code provided with {\cvodes}. This example models an atmospheric 
release with an advection-diffusion PDE in 2-D or 3-D and computes the gradient 
with respect to source parameters of the space-time average of the squared norm
of the concentration.
Given a known velocity field $v(t,x)$, the transport equation for
the cncentration $c(t,x)$ in a domain $\Omega$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{e:pvakx_PDE}
  \begin{split}
    \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} - k \nabla^2 c + v \cdot \nabla c + f = 0 \, , 
    &\text{ in } (0,T) \times \Omega \\
    \frac{\partial c}{\partial n} = g \, ,
    &\text{ on } (0,T) \times \partial\Omega \\
    c = c_0(x) \, ,
    &\text{ in } \Omega \text{ at } t = 0 \, ,
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega$ is a box in ${\mathbb{R}}^2$ or ${\mathbb{R}}^3$ and $n$ is the 
normal to the boundary of $\Omega$.
We assume homogeneous boundary conditions ($g = 0$) and a zero initial
concentration everywhere in $\Omega$ ($c_0(x) = 0$). The wind field has only a
nonzero component in the $x$ direction given by a Poiseuille profile along the 
direction $y$.

Using adjoint sensitivity analysis, the gradient of
\begin{equation}\label{e:pvakx_G}
  G(p) = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^T \int_\Omega \| c(t,x) \|^2 \, d\Omega \, dt
\end{equation}
is obtained as
\begin{equation}\label{e:pvakx_dGdp}
  \frac{dG}{dp_i} = \int_t \int_\Omega \lambda(t,x) \delta(x_i) \, d\Omega \, dt
  = \int_t \lambda(t,x_i) \, dt \, ,
\end{equation}
where $x_i$ is the location of the source of intensity $p_i$ and $\lambda$
is solution of the adjoint PDE
\begin{equation}\label{e:pvakx_ADJ}
  \begin{split}
    - \frac{\partial\lambda}{\partial t} - k \Delta\lambda - v \cdot \lambda = c(t,x)  \, ,
    &\text{ in } (T,0) \times \Omega \\
    (k \nabla\lambda + v \lambda) \cdot n = 0 \, ,
    &\text{ on } (0,T) \times \partial\Omega \\
    \lambda = 0 \, ,
    &\text{ in } \Omega \text{ at } t = T \, .
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%%
The PDE (\ref{e:pvakx_PDE}) is semi-discretized in space with central finite differences,
with the boundary conditions explicitely taken into account by using layers of ghost cells 
in every direction. If the direction $x^i$ of $\Omega$ is discretized into $m_i$
intervals, this leads to a system of ODEs of dimension 
$N = \prod_1^d (m_i+1)$, with $d=2$, or $d=3$.
The source term $f$ is parameterized as a piecewise constant function and yielding
$N$ parameters in the problem. The nominal values of the source parameters correspond
to two Gaussian sources.

The adjoint PDE (\ref{e:pvakx_ADJ}) is discretized to a system of ODEs in a similar fashion.
The space integrals in (\ref{e:pvakx_G}) and (\ref{e:pvakx_dGdp}) are simply approximated
by their Riemann sums, while the time integrals are resolved by appending pure quadrature
equations to the systems of ODEs.

The code for this example is listed in \A\ref{s:pvakx_c}. It uses BDF with the {\cvspgmr}
linear solver and the {\cvbbdpre} preconditioner for both the forward and the backward
integration phases. The value of $G$ is computed on the forward phase as a quadrature,
while the components of the gradient $dG/dP$ are computed as quadratures during the
backward integration phase. All quadrature variables are included in the corresponding 
error tests.

Communication between processes for the evaluation of the ODE right-hand sides involves
passing the solution on the local boundaries (lines in 2-D, surfaces in 3-D) to 
the 4 (6 in 3-D) neighboring processes. This is implemented in the function 
\id{f\_comm}, called in \id{f} and \id{fB} before evaluation of the local residual 
components. Since there is no additional communication required for the {\cvbbdpre}
preconditioner, a \id{NULL} pointer is passed for \id{gloc} and \id{glocB} in the
calls to \id{CVBBSPrecAlloc} and \id{CVBBDPrecAllocB}, respectivley.

For the sake of clarity, the \id{pvakx} example does not use the most 
memory-efficient implementation possible, as the local segment of the 
solution vectors (\id{y} on the forward phase and \id{yB} on the backward phase)
and the data received from neighboring processes is loaded into a temporary 
array \id{y\_ext} which is then used exclusively in computing the local components
of the right-hand sides.

Note that if \id{pvakx} is given any command line argument, it will generate
a series of MATLAB files which can be used to visualize the solution.
Results for a 2-D simulation and adjoint sensitivity analysis with \id{pvakx}
on a $80 \times 80$ grid and $2 \times 4 = 8$ processes are shown in Fig.~\ref{f:pvakx2D}.
Results in 3-D \footnote{The name of executable for the 3-D version is \id{pvakx3D}.},
